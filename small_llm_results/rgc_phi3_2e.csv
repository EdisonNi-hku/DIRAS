It mentions the company's efforts to minimize climate-related risks and capitalize on opportunities, which indirectly suggests a strategic approach to sustainability. However, it does not explicitly mention any financial projections, analysis of investment requirements, risk assessments related to the sustainability transition, expected changes in market share or competitive advantage, details on funding sources for the sustainability transition, or metrics for tracking financial performance in relation to sustainability goals. Therefore, while the paragraph indicates a strategic direction towards sustainability, it lacks direct information on how this strategy is expected to impact financial performance over time.

It mentions the company's support for medical research in ALS, including partnerships with medical institutions and funding for experimental treatments for patients. This directly relates to the company's efforts to improve health outcomes and access to treatment for a specific medical condition, which is a form of social contribution. Additionally, the involvement of employees in fundraising activities for ALS patients demonstrates the company's engagement in social causes, further contributing to the answer. However, the paragraph does not cover a broad range of social contributions such as community development projects, employee well-being programs, or efforts to promote diversity and inclusion, which are also part of the background information.

Fashion experiments, studies products for disabled people, for example collections for wheelchair users. Others try to combine fragility and sustainability by creating a new strength. The for-profit world has realised that it is no longer enough to recover products, we must also recover people.From zero to half a thousand: what happens when solidarity becomes contagious? It was 2007 when six parents founded the association. Underlying this was the idea that everyone should do their share of the'investment'. Just as families had to put energy and passion into it, communities could engage in fundraising, while public bodies would play the role of facilitators. Businesses would eventually recognise the economic value of what we do. And so it went: in little more than ten years we have become a reference for 130 families, and then for another 200 who find answers for their children.

<paragraph>: ""Work done during 2022We, like the entire industry, are at the beginning of a challenging transition that will require changing our work methods and closer monitoring. One example is that several certification systems are already being adapted to the EU taxonomy, which sets a new standard for the industry. Our disclosures for 2022 are based on our current interpretation of the rules and can alter as praxis develops and general knowledge about the EU taxonomy grows. Over the past year, together with our industry, we have put a great deal of energy into comprehending and interpreting the criteria. We have also worked on building up our capacity to measure the relevant data we need to evaluate taxonomy criteria and on producing a support tool to use in projects where meeting the criteria is a prerequisite. Our focus has been on crucial activities and climate and vulnerability analyses, and going forward our ambition is to completely integrate this into our ordinary way of working.""

<paragraph>: ""It is well known that we need to drastically reduce our dependence on fossil fuels in order to achieve the goal of limiting global warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius. But there is less awareness that we have natural solutions to the climate crisis available right now. For example, the earth's forests sponge up 30 percent of the carbon dioxide we release into the atmosphere each year-and they will keep doing this work for us if we make sure they are not cut down.In this section, you can read about how WCS is leading global efforts to advance nature-positive solutions to the climate crisis-from protecting the forests of the Congo Basin, the largest tropical net carbon sink on Earth, to conserving the peatlands of boreal Canada, which store even more carbon than intact forests. And since some of the effects of climate change are unavoidable, WCS is also working to help wildlife, ecosystems, and communities adapt to changing conditions.""

<paragraph>: ""DAN: Climate change fundamentally threatens our core mission to save wildlife and wild places; we've all seen the harm done by worsening droughts and wildfires. But WCS also brings distinctive strengths to solving this crisis. Forests remain our greatest climate asset; globally, they remove a third of the CO$_{2}$ emitted each year from burning fossil fuels. And most of that removal is done by the kind of high-integrity forests and peatlands WCS field programs help protect.With our on-the-ground presence in more than 50 countries-including thousands of staff working closely with governments and communities-WCS can be a significant piece of the global climate solution. The key is to bring financial investment into conservation in a whole new way. Intact forests keep the planet as much as a degree cooler than it would be without their help. If we value that natural climate control-which is worth tens of trillions of dollars to the global economy-we can create sustainable protections for these vital ecosystems, the wildlife they shelter, and the climate itself.""

I came to WCS because I think, right now, it's where I can have the greatest impact-building on the unrivaled work of our field conservation programs and connecting those assets to global policy and financesolutions. It's clear that we are in no way separate from nature. Whether in the most remote regions or in the heart of a city, we are all linked to one another and to our animal relatives. We are mutually dependent. Africa's forest elephants, for instance, are like gardeners: they weed out smaller brush, which allows big trees to get bigger, locking away carbon. A single elephant contributes to many additional tons of CO$_{2}$ storage, helping regulate our climate. As an ecosystem ecologist, I think of species as parts of a larger system, and that's true of humans as well.""

It mentions the use of various methodologies and processes, such as analyzing corporate responsibility reporting standards, engaging with third-party ESG advisors, and reviewing customer inquiries on ESG-related topics. However, it does not specify any particular metrics or indicators used to assess climate-related risks and opportunities. The focus is more on the process of identifying ESG topics rather than on the specific metrics that would help ensure performance aligns with strategy and risk management processes in the context of climate change. Therefore, while the paragraph provides insight into the organization's approach to ESG disclosure, it does not directly answer the question regarding the metrics for assessing climate-related risks and opportunities.

It mentions the proactive identification and management of ESG risks and opportunities, indicating a structured approach to addressing these issues. However, the paragraph does not specifically mention climate-related scenarios, such as a 2°C target or lower scenario, or detail how the organization's strategy is resilient to climate physical risks. It lacks direct information on operational and financial exposure to climate-related risks, strategies to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, investment in climate resilience, scenario planning exercises, stakeholder engagement on climate resilience, plans to adapt to physical climate risks, or initiatives to enhance ecosystem resilience. Therefore, while the paragraph shows a general commitment to ESG governance, it does not directly answer the question regarding the organization's strategy's resilience to different climate-related scenarios or physical climate risks.

It mentions the development of an emissions baseline, a decarbonization roadmap, and the integration of environmental sustainability into business decisions. This indicates a strategic approach to managing climate-related risks and aligns with the question's interest in how the organization's strategy accounts for climate change impacts and physical risks. However, the paragraph does not explicitly mention resilience to different climate-related scenarios, including a 2°C target or lower scenario, nor does it detail how the organization plans to adapt to physical climate risks beyond GHG emissions reduction.

It mentions the development of business continuity strategies, including recovery strategies to mitigate business disruptions, and the existence of facility-specific business resilience plans. These plans are designed to protect processes and continuity, which directly relates to the organization's resilience in the face of climate physical risks. Additionally, the paragraph discusses the organization's risk management framework (GRC) and its approach to risk mitigation, transfer, acceptance, or control, which is crucial for assessing the organization's overall resilience strategy. However, the paragraph does not explicitly mention climate-related scenarios or the 2°C target, which are central to the question. Therefore, while the paragraph is helpful in showing the organization's general approach to risk management and resilience, it does not fully answer the question regarding resilience to different climate-related scenarios or specifically to a 2°C target or lower scenario.

It mentions the organization's belief in setting multiple metrics to comprehensively manage climate-related risks and opportunities, which is relevant to understanding the organization's resilience strategy in the face of climate change. However, the paragraph does not explicitly mention how the organization's strategy is adapted to different climate-related scenarios, including a 2°C target or lower scenario, nor does it detail specific plans or policies to adapt to physical climate risks. Therefore, while the paragraph is somewhat helpful in showing the organization's general approach to managing climate-related risks, it does not fully answer the question regarding the resilience of the organization's strategy under specific climate scenarios or in managing physical climate risks.

The mention of setting emissions reduction targets and collecting data on Scope 3 emissions (which includes purchased goods and services, capital goods, upstream transportation and distribution, and business travel) suggests that the organization is actively identifying and assessing climate-related risks, particularly in terms of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. This aligns with the background information's examples, such as the use of climate risk assessment tools (in this case, the CDP questionnaire and the Carbon Management Program) and the process of regularly monitoring and updating the organization's understanding of climate-related risks. However, the paragraph does not explicitly mention specific methods, tools, or strategies for identifying and assessing climate-related risks beyond emissions reduction and reporting, nor does it detail the organization's overall risk management framework or stakeholder engagement processes for identifying climate risks. Therefore, while the paragraph is helpful in showing that the organization has processes in place for identifying and assessing climate-related risks, it only partially answers the question by focusing on emissions data and reporting rather than a comprehensive overview of all processes used.

It mentions the use of a CSR Self-Assessment Questionnaire to collect, evaluate, and score sustainability information from suppliers, which is a method for identifying risks related to sustainability and climate change. Additionally, the paragraph discusses the expansion of supplier questionnaires to engage with a significant portion of suppliers to inform strategy on reducing scope 3 emissions, which directly relates to assessing and managing climate-related risks. This information aligns with several examples of what the question is looking for, such as the use of tools or strategies to assess climate-related risks and the process of engaging with external entities (suppliers) to gather information on sustainability practices.

I came to WCS because I think, right now, it's where I can have the greatest impact-building on the unrivaled work of our field conservation programs and connecting those assets to global policy and financesolutions. It's clear that we are in no way separate from nature. Whether in the most remote regions or in the heart of a city, we are all linked to one another and to our animal relatives. We are mutually dependent. Africa's forest elephants, for instance, are like gardeners: they weed out smaller brush, which allows big trees to get bigger, locking away carbon. A single elephant contributes to many additional tons of CO$_{2}$ storage, helping regulate our climate. As an ecosystem ecologist, I think of species as parts of a larger system, and that's true of humans as well.""

<paragraph>: ""Important sustainability issuesThe Nordic countries still have a long way to go to achieve carbon neutrality despite targets and plans for net zero emissions of greenhouse gases. The construction and real estate industries have a vital part to play in climate transition and are thereforedriving various initiatives to reduce carbon emissions in line with the Paris Agreement, particularly through the Road map for fossil free competitiveness that Peab has also signed onto. The construction and civil engineering industry, together with seven other trade organizations, work within the road map to achieve a climate neutral construction sector. This work comprises the entire value chain from planning and implementation to demolition and reuse.Creating sustainable cities includes energy efficient buildings and a construction process that uses material and processes in a climate-adapted manner. Looking at it from a broader perspective, cities' sustainability relies on energy-smart community planning with, for example, circular flows that lower climate impact.""

<paragraph>: ""DAN: Climate change fundamentally threatens our core mission to save wildlife and wild places; we've all seen the harm done by worsening droughts and wildfires. But WCS also brings distinctive strengths to solving this crisis. Forests remain our greatest climate asset; globally, they remove a third of the CO$_{2}$ emitted each year from burning fossil fuels. And most of that removal is done by the kind of high-integrity forests and peatlands WCS field programs help protect.With our on-the-ground presence in more than 50 countries-including thousands of staff working closely with governments and communities-WCS can be a significant piece of the global climate solution. The key is to bring financial investment into conservation in a whole new way. Intact forests keep the planet as much as a degree cooler than it would be without their help. If we value that natural climate control-which is worth tens of trillions of dollars to the global economy-we can create sustainable protections for these vital ecosystems, the wildlife they shelter, and the climate itself.""

<paragraph>: ""Greenhouse Gas Emissions and Energy ManagementTo drive action towards our carbon neutral goal, we are focusing first on measuring and tracking progress on our operational fuel and electricity usage (scopes 1 and 2), where we have the most immediate impact.Inspiring The Next GenerationFrom 2019 to 2021, our operational emissions decreased by approximately 13%. Members of our manufacturing teams in our factories globally have been instrumental in reducing our impact. We have successfully completed multiple energy efficiency projects in 2021, including lighting system improvements and air compressor and HVAC chiller upgrades. We are in the process of implementing additional improvements, including the installation of sub-metering systems at our facility in Hungary, which will allow for better monitoring and control of energy consumption.We are also focusing on renewable electricity to reduce our operational emissions. In 2021, our first on-site solar installation came online in Pune, India. The installation is anticipated to produce around 163,200 kWh annually. In addition to the environmental benefit of renewable electricity, the Pune installation affords our site with increased energy independence, bolstering resiliency in a climate-uncertain future. By 2025, HARMAN has committed to sourcing 100% renewable electricity across our entire global manufacturing footprint, aligned with our RE100 targets.""

It mentions the company's efforts in training key personnel on data and information collection, developing a climate strategy workshop, and planning to engage the supply chain to gather Scope 3 data. These actions indicate that the company has a structured approach to managing and reducing its carbon footprint, which is a critical component of achieving net-zero emissions. However, the paragraph does not explicitly mention a ""clearly stated net-zero target"" or a specific year by which the company aims to achieve net-zero emissions.

<paragraph>: ""The Geberit Group stands for an ambitious and implementation-oriented approach in its activities. This also applies to the new CO$_{2}$ strategy developed in 2021 and implemented in the reporting year.. The goal in the future is to continue to reduce CO$_{2}$ intensity by an average of 5% per year. As such, Geberit is looking to achieve a long-term reduction in absolute CO$_{2}$ emissions from 183,886 tonnes in 2021 to 121,000 tonnes by 2035. In comparison with the reference year 2015, relative CO$_{2}$ emissions are to be reduced by 70% by 2030 and by 80% by 2035, while absolute CO$_{2}$ emissions are to fall by 47% and 50% by 2030 and 2035 respectively. The targeted reduction in emissions (Scopes 1 and 2) is equivalent to a contribution to a reduction path that limits CO$_{2}$ emissions to 'well below 2°C' above pre-industrial levels.A central element of the new CO$_{2}$ strategy is its integration in all relevant and existing business processes as well as the handling of CO$_{2}$ emissions as external costs by means of internal CO$_{2}$ pricing.""

The information is more about tracking progress on emissions reduction rather than setting a net-zero goal or detailing a strategy to reach it. Therefore, while the paragraph shows the company is monitoring and reporting on its emissions, it does not directly answer the question regarding the existence of a net-zero target and a transition plan.

<paragraph>: ""As a community builder Peab has broad and diversified operations. We are active in four Nordic countries with an extensive geographic presence as well as customers in both the private and public sectors. Our four business areas Construction, Civil Engineering, Industry and Project Development are independent but ensure through collaboration that we utilize local resources as far as possible in the form of our own personnel and input goods. In other words, Peab's business comprises many different kinds of activities that come under the EU taxonomy. At the same time Peab's operations are characterized by further conditions that provide the framework for how our reporting according to the EU taxonomy should be understood. Our operations are primarily carried out as projects where every project is unique, which makes evaluating each project demanding. In our construction and civil engineering operations customers by and large formulate the specifications of the project. This reduces Peab's ability to influence the outcome, even if we work actively with holding dialogues with customers early on. In addition, lead times are long in the industry-from zoning to completed project-and therefore it takes years before new requirements are realized in operations and reporting.""

<paragraph>: ""The criteria for DNSH have been evaluated and Peab's ECO-products are considered to meet them.· Climate change adaptation: Considered met because we have performed climate risk and vulnerability analyses for all the manufacturing units of ECO-products and identified possible risk redu cing measures.· The sustainable use and protection of water and marine resources: Considered met because of compliance with valid laws since water activities and other situations that affect environment quality norms for water always require an Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) and taking relevant safeguards.· The transition to a circular economy: Considered met because Peab applies the industry's guidelines for waste management that steer towards sorting for possible material recycling. Peab also regularly evaluates the possibility of circular material flows concerning both input raw material for production and the recyclability of manufactured products. Examples of this are the binder Merit, based on slag which is a byproduct from the steel industry, our ECO-Ballast (ECO-Mineral aggregates) which is based on 100 percent reused raw material and is used in concrete and asphalt as well as reclaimed asphalt pavement as raw material in our paving production.

Accordingly, the area of ceramics, which accounts for around two-thirds of all Geberit's CO$_{2}$ emissions, has the largest structural savings potential. This includes a special focus on the reduction of scrap rates. The firing process and the use of the resulting waste heat will be further optimised. This can be used for other process steps, such as drying the cast plaster moulds or ceramic blanks. Furthermore, projects were launched to investigate the possibilities of switching to renewable energy sources-for example, ecologically produced hydrogen-in the long term as well as the systematic reuse of ceramic waste.Fuel consumption is determined primarily by the company's own and leased fleet of cars and delivery vans.

StrategyAccording to TCFD guidelines, a distinction is made between physical risks and transitional risks and opportunities. Material risks and their financial significance are regularly reviewed and assessed by Geberit as part of risk management.Physical risks include short-term acute, extreme weather events and longer-term chronic, localised effects such as increasing average temperatures, rising sea levels or increasing periods of drought. These short-term and longer-term effects may result in damage to property and infrastructure, adversely affect logistics operations or cause disruptions in the supply chain. Rising average temperatures and an increase in the number of hot days lead to increased energy demand for the cooling of machines, processes and workplaces during the summer months, as well as to a possible reduction in energy demand for heating buildings in the winter. Rising sea levels may mean that production sites located on the sea have to be protected against flooding.""

<paragraph>: ""Overall Scope 3 emissions were reduced by 6% compared to the previous year. OVS has defined Scope 3 emissionreduction targets on categories that are particularly relevant and where there is significant scope for action.As can be seen from the following table, thanks to an improved raw materials portfolio with a greater selection of low-impact materials and the reduction in the incidence of shipments by air, Scope 3 emissions decreased by 11% compared to 2019, substantially in line with the target of 12.6% defined by the objectives approved by SBTi. Considering the reduction per kg of product, the reduction is 12%.The significant reduction in transport emissions comes from the almost complete elimination of air transport. The slight upward shift from 2021 in emissions related to purchased Goods and Services should be read in light of the fact that in 2022, some purchases of finished goods were brought forward compared to the normal procurement curve typically adopted.""

We are pleased to report on the results of our GHG assessment, which includes a 19% reduction in Scope 1 and 2 GHG emissions and a reduction of 7,813 MWh of energy in fiscal 2022 compared to our fiscal 2018 baseline. In calendar 2023, we plan to take the next steps in defining our long-range goals to further reduce our Scope 1 and 2 carbon emissions and assess our Scope 3 emissions.""

However, it does not provide specific details on the categories of Scope 3 emissions the company reports, nor does it mention the percentage of total emissions that Scope 3 represents for the reporting period. The focus is primarily on Scope 1 and 2 emissions, with a mention of plans to assess Scope 3 emissions in the future, but without any detailed breakdown or percentage data for Scope 3 emissions. Therefore, while the paragraph indicates an awareness and effort towards understanding and reducing GHG emissions, it does not directly answer the question regarding the categories of Scope 3 emissions and their percentage of total emissions.

Additionally, the mention of the Toyota Global Risk Management Standard (TGRS) and the specific impact on businesses, strategy, and financial planning suggests that the organization has established frameworks and standards for understanding and quantifying climate-related risks and opportunities. However, the paragraph does not provide specific targets or metrics that the organization uses to understand, quantify, and benchmark these risks and opportunities, nor does it detail how the organization is performing against these targets. Therefore, while the paragraph indicates that the organization is engaged in managing climate-related risks and opportunities, it lacks the detailed information on specific targets and performance against these targets that the question seeks.

<paragraph>: ""DAN: Climate change fundamentally threatens our core mission to save wildlife and wild places; we've all seen the harm done by worsening droughts and wildfires. But WCS also brings distinctive strengths to solving this crisis. Forests remain our greatest climate asset; globally, they remove a third of the CO$_{2}$ emitted each year from burning fossil fuels. And most of that removal is done by the kind of high-integrity forests and peatlands WCS field programs help protect.With our on-the-ground presence in more than 50 countries-including thousands of staff working closely with governments and communities-WCS can be a significant piece of the global climate solution. The key is to bring financial investment into conservation in a whole new way. Intact forests keep the planet as much as a degree cooler than it would be without their help. If we value that natural climate control-which is worth tens of trillions of dollars to the global economy-we can create sustainable protections for these vital ecosystems, the wildlife they shelter, and the climate itself.""

<paragraph>: ""Q: How did you come to this work?DAN: I've focused on the intersection between forests and climate for more than 30 years, as a professor and then working in philanthropy. I came to WCS because I think, right now, it's where I can have the greatest impact-building on the unrivaled work of our field conservation programs and connecting those assets to global policy and financesolutions. It's clear that we are in no way separate from nature. Whether in the most remote regions or in the heart of a city, we are all linked to one another and to our animal relatives. We are mutually dependent. Africa's forest elephants, for instance, are like gardeners: they weed out smaller brush, which allows big trees to get bigger, locking away carbon. A single elephant contributes to many additional tons of CO$_{2}$ storage, helping regulate our climate. As an ecosystem ecologist, I think of species as parts of a larger system, and that's true of humans as well.""

It mentions the monitoring of various environmental factors such as surface water, sediments, discharge water, soil, air quality, noise, vibrations, and biotics. Additionally, it discusses the company's adherence to environmental regulations through compliance audits and the approval of its environmental audit by the Ministry of the Environment, Water and Ecological Transition.

While the paragraph does not explicitly mention tools or instruments used to manage climate risks, the environmental monitoring and compliance audits can be considered part of a broader risk management strategy. These activities likely contribute to the company's ability to identify, assess, and mitigate environmental risks, which are a component of climate risk management. However, the paragraph does not cover specific tools or frameworks like climate risk assessment software, an Environmental Management System, or the TCFD framework, which are more directly related to managing climate risks.

Therefore, the paragraph is somewhat helpful because it shows the company's commitment to environmental monitoring and compliance, which are relevant to managing climate risks, but it does not directly answer the question regarding specific tools or instruments for climate risk management.

<paragraph>: ""Paolo Lezza : Denim Privè is a company that is also very attentive to working conditions: through the technologies they use, e.g. laser and ozone, they try to avoid all the garment treatment processes that used to be carried out manually, thus significantly reducing the aggressive impact on workers' health. Returning instead to the subject of water, the company is also far ahead on the 'zero liquid discharge' theme: within a year, all water used in the production processes will be part of a closed cycle that allows it to be constantly reused, without the emission of waste water. What were the difficulties and challenges you had to overcome along the way? Paolo Lezza : All advanced technologies have a cost: the question is how to achieve the right efficiency to reduce it and remain competitive in the market. In this regard, the search for talent and human resources capable of handling these new technologies, which are also based on artificial intelligence, remains a key issue: in the case of the latest generation of machines, it is not so straightforward to find the right recipe, the appropriate mix of substances to be inserted or sprayed. Each process requires different skills: we, as OVS, are committed to supporting our supplier in these challenges, in order to achieve maximum efficiency for them and, consequently, also for us.""

<paragraph>: ""We could have done better, but purchases of organic cotton have decreased due to less availability on the market. To fulfil our commitment, we have thus increased the recycled portion on both cotton and polyester, as well as focused on specific materials from particularly emissionfriendly suppliers. In 2022, this was certainly more challenging, especially in light of the general and significant increase in raw material costs. In spite of this, we have chosen to go beyond these limits and take risks, e.g. by increasing sales prices, to ensure an increasingly sustainable product offering in line with our emission reduction targets. However, it is necessary to think in a large-scale perspective, without focusing on individual capsules, in order to strengthen partnerships with the most virtuous suppliers and respond to customers who are increasingly sensitive to sustainability issues.""

<paragraph>: ""Accidents and days lost (GRI 403-9) The manufacture of sanitary products can generally be said to have a low level of risks at the workplace. Nevertheless, there are still some individual activities which entail an increased risk of accidents. Typical workplace risks are the lifting and carrying of heavy loads, working at heights and in noisy environments, as well as handling hot surfaces and hazardous substances. As part of the Geberit Safety System, the workplace risks are assessed systematically and appropriate measures implemented to protect the employees. Geberit is consistently pursuing the creation of safe and clean workstations at the production plants. This is carried out, for example, by optimising and modernising the systems and processes (e.g. an appliance for deburring sharp sheet edges when manufacturing installation modules), the replacement of hazardous substances (e.g. substitution of the pickling process in the manufacture of metal fittings) and the reduction of dust and noise emissions (e.g. by using more efficient extraction devices and filters in ceramic production). Workstations are also being further optimised from an ergonomic point of view through the increasing use of robots or lifting aids.""

<paragraph>: ""20 UEC 2022 Sustainability Report NYSE:  UEC Message from the CEO FY22 Highlights About UEC Our ESG Strategy Governance Environment Social ESG Performance Biodiversity Management Minimizing our impact on the land, plants and animals in the areas where we operate is a top priority for UEC. When it comes to biodiversity management, we are guided by local regulations, with a commitment to minimizing our disturbance of the local biodiversity. The ISR method we currently use results in significantly less land disturbance than underground or open pit mining. Therefore, our operational footprint in Texas and Wyoming is quite small compared to conventional mining. This is primarily due to the lack of tailings produced in the ISR process compared to conventional mining. Tailings facilities, which hold radioactive material, are often tens of acres in size and must be maintained indefinitely. ISR contains no tailings and, therefore, does not require this additional land. Further, none of our permitted sites are in or near areas that hold protected conservation status or endangered species habitat, according to U.S. federal guidelines.""

This program was designed to, among other things, improve product and service quality, reduce cost principally in our manufacturing and supply chain operations and ensure sustainability. Our Operational Excellence Program has helped contribute to overall reductions in our GHG emissions and energy by further rightsizing our geographic footprint, focusing manufacturing operations in locations with more energy-efficient power grids and upgrading our global facilities. For example, in fiscal 2022 we began the relocation of our Leetsdale, Pennsylvania manufacturing operations to a new Center of Excellence in Clinton, Pennsylvania. The Clinton facility incorporates several environmentally-focused features, including smart controls on the HVAC systems and a recycled compressor heat system for more efficient temperature control.

As a child I often heard tigers, saw their tracks, sometimes met them directly. But I never feared them, or considered them my enemy.

UEC expects our management team, employees and contractors to be good stewards of the water we use in all phases of our operations, from exploration to restoration. Our operational sites do not face any withdrawal or scarcity risks and do not operate in regions with High or Extremely High Baseline Water Stress. All of our ISR projects use ore-hosted groundwater that does not meet primary or secondary drinking water standards and should only be used for industry. Our goal is to restore the orehosted groundwater back to pre-mining concentrations of metals, metalloids, cations and anions and total dissolved solids. To do this, we use reverse osmosis ('RO'), a water purification process that uses pressurized membranes to separate ions, unwanted molecules and larger particles from affected water. After processing through the RO unit, the treated water-roughly 75 percent of the groundwater used-is returned to the affected aquifer through injection wells.""

It also mentions initiatives aimed at reducing pollution, waste, and the use of resources, as well as efforts to recycle and reuse materials. These actions indicate a commitment to sustainability and environmental responsibility, which are components of resilience in the face of climate-related scenarios. However, the paragraph does not specifically address the organization's strategy for different climate-related scenarios, including a 2°C target or lower scenario, nor does it detail how the organization's strategy accounts for climate physical risks.

However, it does not specifically address the organization's resilience to different climate-related scenarios, including a 2°C target or lower scenario, or how the organization's strategy considers climate physical risks. The paragraph mentions the development of special projects and the commitment to considering environmental and social footprints, but it lacks details on operational and financial exposure to climate-related risks, scenario planning exercises, or specific initiatives to adapt to physical climate risks. Therefore, while the paragraph touches on aspects of sustainability strategy, it does not directly answer the question regarding climate resilience and physical risk management.

<paragraph>: ""Reuse of products and packaging materials (GRI 301-3) Due to their long service life and the way in which they are installed, Geberit products can only be reused or recycled to a very limited extent. A targeted improvement in recyclability can be achieved by using recyclable thermoplastics instead of nonrecyclable duroplast plastics, as is the case with the manufacture of a WC seat and lid at the plant in Pfullendorf (DE). In the case of packaging materials, Geberit's goal-also as part of eco-design workshops-is to keep amounts as low as possible, to continuously increase the share of recycled material, and to simplify the recycling and return processes. Efforts to reduce packaging amounts are already starting to bear fruit. For example, certain packaging levels are being omitted, bags reduced in size or thinner foils used, while instructions are printed directly on the packaging rather than on paper, or replaced by a QR code. In addition, care is being taken to avoid the use of polystyrene (EPS) wherever possible and, where necessary, to replace it with recyclable cardboard. A good example here is the  redesign of the packaging for the sanitary flush unit. Proven standard packaging-introduced as part of an effort to reduce complexity-is now also being reviewed. Since 2021, WC lids are shipped in cardboard boxes that have been reduced in size as far as possible. These boxes are almost four times lighter than those used previously, cause 70% fewer CO$_{2}$ emissions and are both easier to use and cheaper to procure. The packaging of the MasterFix fittings was also revised in the reporting year. The annual material savings amount to 1.8 tonnes of cardboard and 58,000 m$^{2}$of plastic foil-an area equivalent to around eight football fields. This results in a saving of around 24 tonnes of CO$_{2}$ per year.""

K&S files an annual CM report with the SEC 7 declaring our due diligence progress with our extensive supply chain on the mine source tracing and the mitigation actions in the event that a conflicted source is found. We require our tier-1 suppliers to provide full disclosure of the origin of 3TG minerals used in their products, including their sub-tier suppliers down to the smelter sources.

It mentions the company's commitment to ESG (Environmental, Social, and Governance) principles, including accountability, integrity, collaboration, and intentionality, and highlights the leadership's focus on setting ambitious and achievable ESG goals. However, it does not detail any specific methods or procedures for climate risk assessment, such as the use of climate risk assessment tools, engagement with external consultants, scenario analysis exertiles, or any other specific processes related to identifying and assessing climate-related risks. Therefore, while the paragraph indicates a general commitment to ESG, it does not directly answer the question regarding the specific processes for climate risk assessment.

On average, a single lithium battery consumes 1,700 fewer kWh/year than a traditional lead battery, which results in an average reduction of 600 kilograms (0.6 metric tons) of CO$_{2}$ e emissions per year per battery. The lithium forklift fleet in Italy currently has nearly 300 operational units and is expected to grow by 10% in 2023. Across Europe, lithium-battery-powered forklifts will also begin replacing traditionally battery-powered forklifts as they reach the end of their useful lives.

<paragraph>: ""Rewilding Bison with Indigenous Partners From the Bronx Zoo to the Great Plains The bison, or buffalo, is an American conservation success story. In the 1800s, tens of millions roamed North America. Those numbers had plummeted to fewer than 1,100 animals when in the early 20th century, WCS sent Bronx Zoo-bred bison out west to re-establish the species in its native habitat. Together with Indigenous nations, we brought bison back from the edge of extinction. Today, WCS uses science-based solutions to conserve this species and supports Indigenous Peoples in maintaining viable populations so that bison can once again fulfill their essential ecological and cultural roles. In 2022, we sent six Bronx Zoo-born genetically pure bison to the Osage Nation's 17,400-hectare ranch in Oklahoma: to augment the genetics of the Osage's existing bison herd, and to help the tribe preserve their cultural heritage and the ecology of their ancestral lands. The return of bison to these lands benefits soil health, carbon storage, and the abundance and diversity of grassland plants, pollinators, amphibians, birds, and mammals, as well as revitalizing cultural and community well-being.""

<paragraph>: ""3 Excursion status means that the water quality has exceeded the permissible limits in either conductivity, chlorides and/or alkalinity which are parameters used to detect if injection fluid is leaving the wellfield. In the case of these five wells, the adjacent salt dome that has very high chlorides and conductivity has moved toward our monitor wells because of the constant bleed that is maintained. UEC is taking weekly samples, as opposed to the bimonthly requirement, but remediation is a challenge since this is not the injection fluid and the water cannot be pulled back. UEC will continue to monitor these wells twice a week and track the water quality. At the start of the new year, UEC will request the Texas Commission on Environmental Quality ('TCEQ') to reassess the status of the wells and if sampling can be returned to the normal schedule.""

It discusses the monitoring frequency, challenges in remediation, and the request for reassessment by the Texas Commission on Environmental Quality (TCEQ). However, it does not address the broader question of how the organization identifies and assesses climate-related risks. The paragraph does not mention any climate risk assessment tools, engagement with climate science experts, scenario analysis exercises, integration of climate risk into the overall risk management framework, stakeholder engagement processes, or policies for assessing new projects for climate-related risks. Therefore, it does not provide information relevant to the question about processes for identifying and assessing climate-related risks.

Landfilled hazardous waste is disposed of through controlled confinement in a landfill that is lined, monitored, and in compliance with government regulations. We formed waste continuous improvement teams at each location, which completed waste stream analyses and developed waste reduction projects. 14 Hazardous waste disposal methods are confirmed by hazardous waste manifests. Non-hazardous waste disposal methods are confirmed based on vendor reports. Waste is reported based on shipment dates from our facilities.

Instead, it lists various standards and indicators related to sustainability, anti-corruption policies, energy management, and workforce health and safety. While it mentions ""Direct (Scope 1) GHG Emissions"" and ""Indirect (Scope 2) GHG Emissions"" under GRI Indicators, this does not specifically indicate a net-zero target or a detailed transition plan. The mention of GHG emissions is a general sustainability indicator but does not provide information on the company's commitment to achieving net-zero emissions or the strategies to do so. Therefore, the paragraph does not offer the specific details required to answer the question about the company's net-zero target and transition plan.

While these initiatives demonstrate the company's commitment to sustainability and environmental stewardship, they do not specifically address the company's net-zero target or outline a transition plan to achieve net-zero greenhouse gas emissions. The information given does not mention any specific year by which the company aims to achieve net-zero emissions, detailed strategies or actions for reducing emissions, investments in renewable energy, efforts to improve energy efficiency, initiatives to offset remaining emissions, policies to engage suppliers in reducing their carbon footprint, or monitoring mechanisms to track progress towards a net-zero target. Therefore, the paragraph does not provide the necessary information to answer the question about whether the company has a clearly stated net-zero target and a transition plan to reach it.

<paragraph>: ""INTRODUCTION GROWING OUR BUSINESS RESPONSIBLY INVESTING IN OUR PEOPLE DRIVING SOCIAL IMPACT REDUCING OUR ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT DISCLOSURE INDEX 32 GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS AND ENERGY USE Over the last five years, Haemonetics has undertaken restructuring-type activities designed to capture efficiencies, enhance commercial capabilities, align our resources and offer our customers better solutions. In addition to improving performance and delivering gross savings, these activities have allowed us to optimize our geographic footprint and modernize certain manufacturing operations in ways that have helped to meaningfully reduce our Scope 1 and 2 greenhouse gas ('GHG') emissions and total energy consumption. In fiscal 2018, we launched a strategic Complexity Reduction Initiative designed to improve operational performance and reduce costs. As part of this initiative, we relocated our global headquarters in fiscal 2020 from a 224,000 square foot campus in Braintree, Massachusetts to a 62,000 square foot LEED and ENERGY STAR certified office space in Boston, Massachusetts. We also took proactive measures during this program to rationalize our global real estate portfolio and consolidate certain locations outside of the U.S.""

<paragraph>: ""In August 2022, 20 K&S Santa Ana, USA team members volunteered to support Second Harvest Food Bank in upkeeping their bell pepper farming area, eradicating weeds growing in the cultivation area so that the harvest goes to those in need. To contribute towards zero waste and conservation of resources, K&S carries out regular recycling efforts such as in Santa Ana, CA, USA where about 9.5 kg of waste was collected to be recycled. In March 2022, three robots from our supplier in Israel were dismantled and recycled at the Ecology for a Protected Community plant, an ecological enterprise specializing in recycling electronic waste. Robots are a form of electronic waste, and improper disposal can lead to the leaching of toxic substances such as lead and mercury into our groundwater and soil. In addition to preventing environmental degradation, K&S hopes to strengthen the employment of people with disabilities. This ecological enterprise employs workers with disabilities, and it was an opportunity to contribute towards reducing stigmatization and ensuring a fair and inclusive workplace for all.""

It also mentions the company's involvement in transportation and fleet management, which is related to Scope 1 emissions. However, it does not mention any indirect emissions (Scope 3) such as those from the production of purchased materials, transportation of purchased fuels, use of sold products and services, waste disposal by third-party services, or emissions related to leased assets and franchises. Therefore, while the paragraph provides valuable information about the company's direct emissions management, it does not contribute to answering the question about scope 3 emissions.

<paragraph>: ""· Geberit also provided sanitary equipment to the 'L'Unique Foundation'. Established by a Swiss sanitary enterprise and based in Basel (CH), this foundation finances the construction and renovation of sanitary facilities at schools in Nepal. The Geberit Group's social commitment is rounded off by a multitude of other initiatives at a local level. At various Geberit sites in Europe, such as Germany, Austria, Poland, France and Switzerland, for example, assembly and packaging work is regularly awarded to workshops for people with disabilities. In the reporting year, this work amounted to CHF 9.5 million and gave around 550 people meaningful work. As a basic principle, all social projects carried out by Geberit are regularly checked by company employees in the respective country or in partnership with non-governmental organisations-including after completion of the projects in question. All donations are neutral from a party political point of view. No donations were made to parties or politicians. This is ensured globally as part of the annual audit of the  Code of Conduct.

<paragraph>: ""Sustainability → Sustainability performance report → Reporting Practice Reporting Practice GRI 3-1 Process of determining material topics Since 2006, Geberit has been reporting in accordance with the guidelines of the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI). In the present report, Geberit implements the current GRI Standards from 2021. The starting point is a  Materiality analysis that has been developed further over the years, which is based on the procedure described in the GRI Standards. An initial internal materiality analysis was thus developed in 2014 as part of workshops with individual members of the Group Executive Board and later approved by the Group Executive Board. The results were then reviewed and amended slightly by an external stakeholder panel. As part of the integration of the ceramics business, a comprehensive review was carried out in 2015. There were no major changes in the material topics. A further review and update of the material topics was carried out in 2018 as part of the switchover to the GRI Standards. In agreement with the Group Executive Board, the update of the materiality analysis in the reporting year focused on aligning it closely with the corporate strategy and sustainability strategy. The previously required listing of many individual GRI aspects was dispensed with. This resulted in fewer topics overall. The names of these topics are based on the corporate strategy and sustainability strategy, resulting in a consolidated name in some cases. The updated materiality analysis was reviewed and amended slightly by an external stakeholder panel in the reporting year. It became clear that a high degree of consensus existed between the internal standpoint of the company and the assessment of the stakeholder panel, see  Panel Statement. The finalised materiality analysis was checked and approved by the Group Executive Board and the Board of Directors.""

Through the use of this technology, SOAP is able to process up to 700 packages per hour, leading to reductions in resource and energy use. HOME SOAP and similar technologies reduce the use of packing materials and reduce package sizing. This allows shipments to use less space on delivery trucks, leading to reduced road miles traveled. Packaging sized to fit can also reduce the likelihood of products becoming damaged during shipping and can require less plastic to fill empty spaces in cartons. In addition to reducing product packaging materials, we also reduce the materials required for shipment packaging.""

In addition to improving performance and delivering gross savings, these activities have allowed us to optimize our geographic footprint and modernize certain manufacturing operations in ways that have helped to meaningfully reduce our Scope 1 and 2 greenhouse gas ('GHG') emissions and total energy consumption. In fiscal 2018, we launched a strategic Complexity Reduction Initiative designed to improve operational performance and reduce costs. As part of this initiative, we relocated our global headquarters in fiscal 2020 from a 224,000 square foot campus in Braintree, Massachusetts to a 62,000 square foot LEED and ENERGY STAR certified office space in Boston, Massachusetts. We also took proactive measures during this program to rationalize our global real estate portfolio and consolidate certain locations outside of the U.S.""

The Board focuses on the quality and scope of Haemonetics' risk management strategies and considers the most significant areas of risk inherent in the company's business strategies and operations as well as the steps that management is taking to mitigate those risks. Additionally, Board committees consider discrete categories of risk relating to their respective areas of responsibility. All committees report to the full Board as appropriate, including when a matter rises to the level of a material or enterprise-level risk. Senior management has overall responsibility for Haemonetics' risk management approach. This responsibility includes identifying, evaluating and addressing potential risks that may exist at the enterprise, strategic, financial, operational, compliance and reporting levels. Haemonetics' Global Internal Audit function, which reports regularly to the Audit Committee, serves as the primary monitoring and testing function for compliance with company-wide policies and procedures.

Our Human Resources team reviews our compensation practices against the markets where we compete on a regular basis to ensure we are able to attract and retain top talent. COMPENSATION Haemonetics provides market-competitive base pay to compensate individuals for technical competencies required for their position and to help provide economic security. In addition to base salary, most of our employees have variable components to their compensation that are tied to achievement of corporate and individual performance goals, the fluctuations of our stock price, or a combination of both. We believe this approach fosters a pay-for-performance culture and, in the case of equity awards, helps to align the interests of employees and shareholders and promote a long-term shareholder perspective. Representatives of our Human Resources team conduct an annual risk assessment of Haemonetics' compensation programs and the findings are reviewed with the Compensation Committee. For fiscal 2022, the Compensation Committee agreed with management's conclusion that Haemonetics' compensation programs are designed with the appropriate balance of risk and reward in relation to Haemonetics' overall business strategy and do not create risk that is reasonably likely to have a material adverse effect on the company.""

A change in the cleaning chemical and washing equipment allowed us to maintain the same level of quality and hygiene, all with cold water. Outcomes By reducing energy that would have been used to heat the water, we were able to deliver financial and environmental savings to the customer. Since 2009, the customer has sent zero waste directly to a landfill. Each week, GXO handles an average of 5,375 metric tons of cardboard and 410 metric tons of plastic waste and washes 4.4 million trays. Twelve GXO sites operating 24/7/365 and employing a staff of 900 make 1.3 million equipment repairs and wash 260 million trays and more than 11 million flower buckets annually.""

Otherwise, the focus of the training courses was on first-line sales managers, of whom around 100 managers from seven European sales companies underwent in-depth training. For 2023, further training courses are planned for sales managers from the EU sales companies. As part of numerous enquiries from the Geberit markets, Corporate Legal Services once again dealt with the permissibility of a wide range of marketing and sales activities under competition law in the reporting year. The enquiries demonstrate a marked sensibility among the employees in the area of antitrust legislation. The external audit of the Geberit compliance organisation by KPMG carried out in 2021 also covered the area of antitrust legislation and closed with good results.""
