[Reason]: The paragraph provides a general overview of HARMAN's commitment to environmental sustainability and outlines specific goals such as reaching carbon neutrality by 2040 and increasing the procurement of renewable electricity. It mentions the company's decarbonization roadmap and efforts in waste reduction and electricity consumption reduction. However, it does not provide any specific information on how these initiatives are expected to impact financial performance over time. There is a mention of a ""Science Based Target (SBTi) in development for validation by 2025"" and a goal to have all electricity across the global manufacturing footprint sourced from renewables by 2025, but these are not directly related to financial performance projections or analyses of investment requirements, ROI, or any other financial implications of the transition plan. Therefore, while the paragraph indicates a commitment to sustainability goals, it does not offer detailed information on the financial impact of these efforts.

[Reason]: The paragraph does not provide any specific information on how the company's strategy for transitioning towards sustainability will impact its financial performance over time. It focuses on the demand for water-saving and sustainable products due to climate change and the company's response to these changes through the development of innovative, durable sanitary products and resource efficiency in production and use. While it mentions the importance of innovation and sustainability in minimizing climate-related risks and utilizing opportunities, it does not offer any financial projections, investment analysis, risk assessments, or details on funding sources related to sustainability that would directly answer the question about financial performance change over time.

It mentions the use of future storylines based on climate change effects to guide its strategy, which indirectly suggests a consideration of how its financial performance might be affected by climate change. However, the paragraph does not provide specific information on how the company expects its financial performance to change over time due to its strategy to achieve sustainability objectives and priorities. It lacks details on forecasted financial statements, investment requirements for sustainability projects, risk assessments related to the transition, or any direct financial performance metrics in relation to sustainability goals. Therefore, while the paragraph hints at a strategic approach that could have financial implications, it does not directly answer the question regarding the financial performance change over time.

[Reason]: The paragraph provided does not contain any specific information on how Toyota expects its financial performance to change over time in relation to its strategy for achieving its environmental and sustainability goals. It mentions the review of the 7th Toyota Environmental Action Plan and references the TCFD recommendations for climate-related financial disclosures but does not offer any detailed projections or analysis of financial impacts, investment requirements, risk assessments, or any other information related to the financial implications of the transition to sustainability as outlined in the background information. Therefore, it does not directly answer the question about the financial performance impact of the transition plan.

[Reason]: The provided paragraph does not contain any information related to the financial performance of the company over time in relation to its sustainability strategy. It primarily discusses the company's efforts in terms of product sustainability and mentions a task force on climate-related financial disclosures (TCFD) and an independent assurance statement. While it indicates a commitment to sustainability and financial disclosure standards, it does not offer any projections or analysis of how these efforts will impact the company's financial health and performance over time. Therefore, it does not address the question regarding the financial implications of the transition plan or how it expects financial performance to change over time.

[Reason]: The paragraph provides information on the social contributions and efforts of two of the company's sites, one in Pennsylvania and the other in Poland. It mentions the team's volunteer hours and fundraising efforts in Pennsylvania, as well as an example of an employee's contribution to a local food bank in Poland. These activities align with the types of information the question is looking for, such as community development projects, employee well-being programs, and efforts to support the local community. However, the paragraph does not cover a wide range of social contributions, such as environmental conservation efforts or initiatives aimed at empowering underrepresented groups. Despite this, it does offer a glimpse into the company's social efforts, which is relevant to the question.

[Reason]: The paragraph provides information about a specific social contribution or effort by K&S, which is their support for medical research in ALS (Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis). This support includes financial contributions to a research program and employee participation in a fundraising walk for ALS patients. This directly addresses the question by showing how the company is engaging in activities that benefit a specific community and are aimed at improving the well-being of others.

<paragraph>: ""It is a crescendo of attempts to bring the non-profit world closer to the profit world. Fashion experiments, studies products for disabled people, for example collections for wheelchair users. Others try to combine fragility and sustainability by creating a new strength. The for-profit world has realised that it is no longer enough to recover products, we must also recover people.From zero to half a thousand: what happens when solidarity becomes contagious? It was 2007 when six parents founded the association. Underlying this was the idea that everyone should do their share of the'investment'. Just as families had to put energy and passion into it, communities could engage in fundraising, while public bodies would play the role of facilitators. Businesses would eventually recognise the economic value of what we do. And so it went: in little more than ten years we have become a reference for 130 families, and then for another 200 who find answers for their children.

[Reason]: The paragraph is helpful for answering the question because it mentions the company's efforts in both social impact and environmental impact reduction. It specifically mentions philanthropic donations and community service as part of their social impact efforts, which directly addresses the question's interest in the social contributions or efforts mentioned by the company. Additionally, it provides information on the company's environmental efforts, such as the completion of a greenhouse gas emissions assessment and plans for future reduction of emissions, which are also relevant to the question. However, the paragraph does not provide detailed information on specific community development projects, employee well-being programs, or other specific social efforts as outlined in the background information. Therefore, while the paragraph is useful in providing a general overview of the company's social and environmental contributions, it does not offer a comprehensive list of all such efforts.

This increase is also a reflection of the greater number of team members across the business.In the second half of FY22 we identified an increase in ladder related incidents, which had previously been on the decline.

Ensuring we implement strong risk assessment and due diligence processes is therefore critical.With greater visibility we have been able to improve the quality of our supplier data within this category, which in turn supported the more detailed modern slavery risk assessment that we undertook in the latter half of 2021. In the research conducted into the suppliers of our Accent owned brands, the majority of our suppliers in this category were rated inherently high for risks of modern slavery as their sourcing location was based on the country of manufacture, which for the suppliers of Accent owned brands is primarily in China. This enabled a more tailored risk assessment and deeper analysis which we are using to target our direct supplier engagement.""

[Reason]: The provided paragraph focuses on the organization's efforts in managing modern slavery risks within its supply chain, particularly in relation to its owned brands and their sourcing locations in China. It discusses the organization's approach to risk assessment and due diligence processes within this specific context. However, it does not mention any metrics related to climate-related risks or opportunities, such as carbon footprint measurement, water usage efficiency, energy efficiency, waste management, supply chain sustainability, climate risk exposure indices, biodiversity impact metrics, employee and community engagement scores, or financial performance metrics linked to sustainability. Therefore, the paragraph does not contain information that would help answer the question about the organization's use of metrics to assess climate-related risks and opportunities and how these metrics align with its strategy and risk management process in the context of environmental sustainability.

[Reason]: The provided paragraph does not offer specific information on the metrics used by the organization to assess climate-related risks and opportunities. It focuses on the governance structure, diversity commitment, and the general mention of an enterprise risk management (ERM) program that includes management of material risks, including climate change and other environmental issues. However, it lacks details on specific measures or indicators used to evaluate these risks and opportunities, such as carbon footprint measurement methodologies, water usage efficiency metrics, energy efficiency indicators, waste management metrics, supply chain sustainability metrics, climate risk exposure indices, biodiversity impact metrics, employee and community engagement scores related to sustainability, and financial performance metrics linked to sustainability. Therefore, it does not directly answer the question regarding the specific metrics used for climate-related risk and opportunity assessment and how they align with the organization's strategy and risk management process.

[Reason]: The paragraph provides information on the organization's approach to managing and engaging with its supply chain, including the use of environmental, health, and safety criteria in its Supplier Monitoring and Engagement strategy. It mentions the organization's efforts in transparency and collaboration through its external engagement and partnership in initiatives like CDP and Walmart's Project Gigaton. This indicates an effort to align with external standards and frameworks that are relevant to environmental sustainability, which is a part of what the question seeks to understand. However, the paragraph does not explicitly mention specific metrics used to assess climate-related risks and opportunities, nor does it detail how these metrics help ensure performance aligns with the organization's strategy and risk management process. Therefore, while the paragraph suggests an organization that is engaged in practices that could be related to managing climate-related risks and opportunities, it lacks the detailed information on specific metrics that would directly answer the question.

It also seeks to understand how these metrics contribute to ensuring that the organization's performance is in line with its strategic goals and risk management practices, particularly in the context of environmental sustainability.

Examples of information that the question is looking for:
1. Carbon footprint measurement methodologies used by the organization to quantify greenhouse gas emissions and track reduction efforts over time.
2. Water usage efficiency metrics, including total water consumption and recycling rates, to assess the organization's impact on local water resources and its efforts in water conservation.
3. Energy efficiency indicators, such as energy consumed per unit of production, to evaluate improvements in reducing energy consumption and transitioning to renewable energy sources.
4. Waste management metrics, including the percentage of waste recycled, to understand the organization's effectiveness in minimizing waste generation and promoting recycling initiatives.
5. Supply chain sustainability metrics, assessing the environmental impact of suppliers and efforts to integrate sustainable sourcing practices.

<question>: ""What metrics does the organization use to assess climate-related risks and opportunities? How do these metrics help ensure that performance aligns with its strategy and risk management process?""
<paragraph>: ""It is well known that we need to drastically reduce our dependence on fossil fuels in order to achieve the goal of limiting global warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius. But there is less awareness that we have natural solutions to the climate crisis available right now. For example, the earth's forests sponge up 30 percent of the carbon dioxide we release into the atmosphere each year-and they will keep doing this work for us if we make sure they are not cut down.In this section, you can read about how WCS is leading global efforts to advance nature-positive solutions to the climate crisis-from protecting the forests of the Congo Basin, the largest tropical net carbon sink on Earth, to conserving the peatlands of boreal Canada, which store even more carbon than intact forests. And since some of the effects of climate change are unavoidable, WCS is also working to help wildlife, ecosystems, and communities adapt to changing conditions.""

<paragraph>: ""DAN: Climate change fundamentally threatens our core mission to save wildlife and wild places; we've all seen the harm done by worsening droughts and wildfires. But WCS also brings distinctive strengths to solving this crisis. Forests remain our greatest climate asset; globally, they remove a third of the CO$_{2}$ emitted each year from burning fossil fuels. And most of that removal is done by the kind of high-integrity forests and peatlands WCS field programs help protect.With our on-the-ground presence in more than 50 countries-including thousands of staff working closely with governments and communities-WCS can be a significant piece of the global climate solution. The key is to bring financial investment into conservation in a whole new way. Intact forests keep the planet as much as a degree cooler than it would be without their help. If we value that natural climate control-which is worth tens of trillions of dollars to the global economy-we can create sustainable protections for these vital ecosystems, the wildlife they shelter, and the climate itself.""

I came to WCS because I think, right now, it's where I can have the greatest impact-building on the unrivaled work of our field conservation programs and connecting those assets to global policy and financesolutions. It's clear that we are in no way separate from nature. Whether in the most remote regions or in the heart of a city, we are all linked to one another and to our animal relatives. We are mutually dependent. Africa's forest elephants, for instance, are like gardeners: they weed out smaller brush, which allows big trees to get bigger, locking away carbon. A single elephant contributes to many additional tons of CO$_{2}$ storage, helping regulate our climate. As an ecosystem ecologist, I think of species as parts of a larger system, and that's true of humans as well.""

[Reason]: The paragraph provides information about SolGold's commitment to environmental sustainability and mentions the use of international standards like the International Finance Corporation (IFC) principles in their Pre-Feasibility Study for the Cascabel project. It also highlights the company's increased total environmental spend, which indicates an effort to manage and protect the environment. However, the paragraph does not specify any metrics or indicators that SolGold uses to assess climate-related risks and opportunities directly. It focuses more on the company's general approach to environmental management and compliance without detailing specific measures or how these metrics are used to ensure performance aligns with strategy and risk management processes.

[Reason]: The paragraph is helpful for answering the question because it provides specific information about the metrics SolGold uses to assess climate-related risks and opportunities. It mentions the company's participation in the Zero Carbon Ecuador Program and outlines the three stages of its decarbonization strategy, which directly addresses the question of what metrics the organization uses to assess climate-related risks and opportunities. Additionally, it details the company's efforts in measuring and reporting greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, which is a key metric in understanding an organization's impact on climate change and its efforts in reducing these emissions.

[Reason]: The paragraph provides specific information about the organization's efforts in measuring and managing CO$_{2}$ emissions, including the integration of annual CO$_{2}$ reduction goals into the company bonus system. This directly addresses parts of the question related to the metrics the organization uses to assess climate-related risks and opportunities, particularly in terms of carbon footprint measurement and the alignment of performance with strategic goals and risk management processes. The mention of external audits of the carbon footprint and the integration of CO$_{2}$ reduction goals into the bonus system shows a clear effort to ensure that performance aligns with the organization's strategy and risk management process.

[Reason]: The paragraph provides information about the governance structure and processes related to Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) issues within the organization, including the establishment of a Sustainability Committee and the hiring of a VP of Sustainability. It mentions the commitment to ensuring the effective and diligent oversight and management of ESG risks and opportunities, and the role of the Board in ESG governance. However, it does not specify the metrics or indicators used by the organization to assess climate-related risks and opportunities directly. The mention of GRI and SASB standards in the context of ESG reporting suggests a framework for the organization's sustainability efforts but does not provide specific details on the metrics employed for climate risk and opportunity assessment. Therefore, while the paragraph indicates a commitment to managing ESG issues, it does not offer the specific information on metrics that the question seeks.

[Reason]: The paragraph provides information on the organization's recognition of climate change as a risk to the communities and its approach to managing this risk through environmental management practices. It mentions the areas within the organization's operations, financial, strategic, and compliance processes that are exposed to climate-related risks. This indicates an awareness and a strategic approach to addressing climate change, which is relevant to the question about the resilience of the organization's strategy when considering different climate-related scenarios. However, the paragraph does not provide detailed information on the organization's short-term and long-term strategies to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, specific investments in climate resilience, or scenario planning exercises. Therefore, while the paragraph is somewhat helpful in understanding the organization's general approach to climate change, it does not fully answer the question regarding the resilience of the organization's strategy in the face of different climate scenarios.

[Reason]: The paragraph provides some information relevant to the question about the organization's resilience to climate-related scenarios. It mentions the organization's long-term objective to exercise strong risk management of ESG-related risks, which includes environmental issues. Additionally, it notes achievements in environmental impact reduction, such as quantifying Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions for specific projects. This indicates an effort to understand and manage environmental risks, which is a part of the organization's strategy to address climate physical risks. However, the paragraph does not explicitly address the organization's strategy in the context of different climate-related scenarios, including a 2°C target or lower scenario. It also lacks details on the organization's short-term and long-term strategies to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, investment in climate resilience, and engagement with stakeholders on climate issues. Therefore, while the paragraph is somewhat helpful in showing the organization's awareness and action towards managing environmental risks, it does not fully answer the question regarding the organization's resilience to different climate scenarios.

[Reason]: The paragraph provides information on the organization's (WCS) approach to climate change, focusing on the importance of natural solutions like protecting forests and peatlands to mitigate carbon dioxide emissions and help ecosystems adapt to changing conditions. It mentions the organization's efforts in advancing nature-positive solutions and its work to help wildlife, ecosystems, and communities adapt to climate change. This information is relevant to understanding the organization's strategy in addressing climate-related risks and opportunities, particularly in the context of limiting global warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius. However, the paragraph does not provide a detailed analysis of the organization's operational and financial exposure to climate-related risks, nor does it discuss specific strategies or investments in resilience to physical climate risks. Therefore, while the paragraph is somewhat helpful in understanding the organization's approach to climate change and its focus on natural solutions, it does not fully answer the question regarding the organization's resilience to different climate-related scenarios or its strategies to manage physical climate risks.

[Reason]: The paragraph provides information on the organization's long-term goals and some specific actions it is taking to achieve these goals, such as the commitment to achieve carbon neutrality by 2040 and the advancement of GXO U.K.'s goal to be net zero by 2045. This indicates a strategic approach to managing and mitigating climate-related risks, which is relevant to the question about the organization's resilience to different climate scenarios. However, the paragraph does not provide detailed information on the organization's operational and financial exposure to climate risks, nor does it discuss how the organization plans to manage physical climate risks or engage with stakeholders on these issues. Therefore, while the paragraph is somewhat helpful in showing the organization's commitment to climate resilience and its strategies for reducing emissions, it does not fully answer the question regarding the organization's resilience to different climate scenarios or its management of physical climate risks.

[Reason]: The paragraph does not directly address the organization's resilience to climate-related scenarios, including a 2°C target or lower scenario, or its strategy to manage climate physical risks. It focuses on the organization's business continuity strategy and its efforts to mitigate business disruptions, including disaster resilience and recovery plans. While it mentions the oversight of business groups and site managers, and the submission of plans for regular audits and assessments, it does not provide information on the organization's long-term strategies to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, its investment in climate resilience, or any specific plans or policies to adapt to physical climate risks. Therefore, it does not offer the specific details or examples of the organization's preparedness and adaptability to potential future climate conditions and events as outlined in the background information.

[Reason]: The paragraph provided does not offer specific information on the organization's resilience to climate-related scenarios, including a 2°C target or lower scenario. It focuses on the organization's environmental and social goals, such as using LED lighting and diverting waste from landfills by 2025.

[Reason]: The paragraph is helpful for answering the question because it provides information on the organization's approach to assessing its compliance with the 'Do No Significant Harm' (DNSH) criteria, specifically in relation to climate change adaptation. It mentions the use of an analysis to identify and assess vulnerability to chronic and acute physical climatic risks, which directly relates to the organization's strategy for managing and mitigating climate physical risks. This information aligns with the types of information the question is looking for, such as details on the organization's strategies to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and their alignment with international climate goals or agreements, and descriptions of scenario planning exercises or risk assessments the organization has conducted to evaluate the impact of various climate-related scenarios on its operations. However, the paragraph does not provide a comprehensive answer to the question as it only mentions the organization's approach to compliance with the DNSH criteria and does not detail the organization's overall resilience strategy or its alignment with a specific global warming target like a 2°C or lower scenario.

[Reason]: The paragraph is helpful for answering the question because it outlines the organization's approach to considering different climate-related scenarios, including a 2°C or lower scenario, in its strategic planning. It mentions the use of future storylines based on risk and opportunity analysis, using scenarios such as those of the International Energy Agency (IEA), to envision three future societies with different climate change effects.

[Reason]: The paragraph is helpful for answering the question because it provides information on how the organization, Toyota, is addressing climate-related risks and its strategy to enhance its resilience in the face of these risks. It mentions the organization's recognition of the risks posed by climate change, such as the increasing severity of natural disasters like storms and flooding, due to higher temperatures and rising sea levels. Additionally, it outlines specific measures Toyota is taking to respond to these risks, such as promoting electrification and the introduction of renewable energy in production processes, taking adaption measures for natural disasters, and supporting the recommendations of the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD). These points align with the types of information the question seeks, such as analysis of operational and financial exposure to climate risks, details on strategies to reduce emissions, and plans to adapt to physical climate risks.

[Reason]: The paragraph is helpful for answering the question because it provides information on how Toyota reviews its strategy based on the risks and opportunities associated with climate-related issues. It mentions the use of the Toyota Global Risk Management Standard (TGRS) to identify risks and prioritize them, which directly relates to the organization's resilience to climate-related scenarios. This indicates that Toyota is actively considering and managing climate-related risks as part of its strategy and financial planning. However, the paragraph does not provide detailed information on the specific strategies or actions taken to mitigate these risks, such as investments in climate resilience or specific initiatives aimed at enhancing ecosystem resilience. Therefore, while the paragraph is useful in showing that Toyota is aware of and managing climate-related risks, it does not fully answer the question regarding the organization's overall resilience to these risks.

[Reason]: The paragraph provides a general overview of the governance structure and the roles of different committees within the organization, including the Sustainability Committee. It mentions that these committees work together to identify ESG (Environmental, Social, and Governance) issues that are relevant to the company's business and its key stakeholders, and to help develop the policies and processes to integrate ESG into the company's long-term strategy and risk management responsibilities. This indicates that the organization has a framework in place for considering a wide range of issues, including those related to climate change, within its overall risk management and strategy development. However, the paragraph does not provide specific details on the processes or tools used to identify and assess climate-related risks, such as the use of climate risk assessment tools, engagement with external experts, or detailed procedures for monitoring and updating the organization's understanding of climate risks. Therefore, while the paragraph suggests that the organization has a governance structure that could be used to address climate-related risks, it does not offer direct information on the specific processes for identifying and assessing these risks.

[Reason]: The paragraph provides information about the organization's governance structure for managing environmental, social, and health and safety (ESG) risks, including climate risk. It mentions the role of the Board in oversight and the establishment of the Sustainability Committee to assist in fulfilling these responsibilities. The committee's composition, its first meeting, and its focus on reviewing and developing the organization's ESG strategy are also included. This information is relevant to understanding the processes the organization uses to identify and assess climate-related risks because it outlines the structure and initial activities of the committee, which is a key component in the organization's approach to managing climate risk. However, the paragraph does not provide detailed information on specific methods, tools, or strategies for identifying and assessing climate risks, such as the use of climate risk assessment tools, engagement with external experts, or scenario analysis exercises. Therefore, while the paragraph is somewhat helpful in understanding the organization's governance for climate risk management, it does not fully answer the question regarding the specific processes used for this purpose.

[Reason]: The paragraph provides information about the organization's governance structure for sustainability, including the role of the ESG steering group and its responsibilities in overseeing sustainability initiatives and risks. It mentions the ESG steering group's involvement in aligning business strategies with evolving ESG strategies and its reporting structure to the Audit and Risk Committee and the Board. This indicates a process of governance and oversight of sustainability and climate-related risks, which is relevant to understanding how the organization identifies and assesses climate-related risks. However, the paragraph does not detail specific methods, tools, or strategies for identifying and assessing climate risks, such as the use of climate risk assessment tools, engagement with external experts, or scenario analysis exercises. It focuses more on the governance and oversight of these activities rather than the specific processes themselves.

[Reason]: The paragraph provides information on the organization's efforts in managing and reducing greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, including their participation in the CDP Climate Change questionnaire and their future plans for disclosing more detailed information on their emissions reduction journey. It also mentions the organization's focus on Scope 3 emissions and the specific categories of emissions it is targeting for data collection. This information is relevant to understanding the organization's approach to managing climate-related risks, as it shows a structured approach to quantifying and managing their impact on the environment. However, the paragraph does not detail the specific processes or tools used for identifying and assessing climate-related risks beyond the mention of the Carbon Management Program and the CDP Climate Change questionnaire. It also does not cover other aspects such as engagement with external experts, regular monitoring of risks, or how these processes are integrated into the overall risk management framework. Therefore, while the paragraph is somewhat helpful in showing the organization's efforts in managing climate-related risks, it does not fully answer the question regarding the processes used for identification and assessment.

You are a helpful assistant who assists human analysts in identifying useful information within sustainability reports for their analysis.

You will be provided with a <question> the analyst seeks to answer, a <paragraph> extracted from a lengthy report, and <background_information> that explains the <question>. <background_information> first explains the <question> and then raises examples to help you to better understand the <question>. Your job is to assess whether the <paragraph> is useful in answering the <question>.

<background_information>: ""Meaning of the question: The question ""What processes does the organization use to identify and assess climate-related risks?"" is asking for information about the specific methods, tools, or strategies that a company employs to recognize and evaluate the potential risks to its operations, financial performance, and overall sustainability that are associated with climate change. This includes understanding how the organization anticipates, quantifies, and plans for the impacts of climate-related phenomena such as extreme weather events, long-term shifts in climate patterns, and regulatory changes aimed at mitigating climate change.

Examples of information that the question is looking for:
1. The use of climate risk assessment tools or software that helps in modeling and predicting potential impacts of climate change on the organization's operations.
2. Engagement with external consultants or experts specializing in climate science or environmental risk to conduct in-depth analyses of the company's vulnerability to climate change.
3. Procedures for regularly monitoring and updating the organization's understanding of climate-related risks, including how often these assessments are conducted and by whom.
4. Description of any scenario analysis exercises undertaken to understand the potential business impact under different climate change scenarios, such as a 2-degree Celsius increase in global temperatures.
5. Details on how the organization incorporates climate risk into its overall risk management framework, including any specific committees or roles dedicated to overseeing climate risk.

[Reason]: The paragraph is helpful for answering the question because it provides information on the organization's processes for identifying and assessing risks, which includes the use of the Enterprise Risk Management (ERM) program and the Enterprise Risk Assessment (ERA).

[Reason]: The paragraph provides information about the organization's commitment to long-term sustainability objectives and its efforts in setting interim climate targets in line with the Science Based Targets initiative (SBTi). It mentions the company's recognition of its role in environmental and social impact mitigation and its efforts in reducing its environmental footprint. However, it does not provide specific details on the processes the organization uses to identify and assess climate-related risks. There is no mention of specific methods, tools, or strategies employed for this purpose, such as the use of climate risk assessment tools, engagement with external experts, or any scenario analysis exercises. Therefore, while the paragraph indicates a general commitment to climate action, it does not directly answer the question regarding the specific processes for identifying and assessing climate-related risks.

I came to WCS because I think, right now, it's where I can have the greatest impact-building on the unrivaled work of our field conservation programs and connecting those assets to global policy and financesolutions. It's clear that we are in no way separate from nature. Whether in the most remote regions or in the heart of a city, we are all linked to one another and to our animal relatives. We are mutually dependent. Africa's forest elephants, for instance, are like gardeners: they weed out smaller brush, which allows big trees to get bigger, locking away carbon.

[Reason]: The paragraph is somewhat helpful for answering the question because it mentions the organization's recognition of climate change as posing risks to its operations and its efforts to integrate environmental management practices into its operations. It also briefly touches on the concept of ""Climate Risk Assessment and Key Policy Development,"" which is relevant to understanding the processes the organization uses to identify and assess climate-related risks. However, the paragraph does not provide specific details on the methods, tools, or strategies employed in this process, such as the use of climate risk assessment tools, engagement with external experts, or a detailed description of the assessment process itself. It also does not cover the broader range of information sought in the question, such as stakeholder engagement processes, scenario analysis exercises, or how climate risk is incorporated into the overall risk management framework.

[Reason]: The paragraph is helpful for answering the question because it provides specific information on the processes the organization uses to identify and assess climate-related risks. It mentions the use of an ERM (Enterprise Risk Management) tool to collect qualitative and quantitative feedback on various risks, including those related to climate change. This directly addresses the first example of information the question is looking for, which is the use of climate risk assessment tools or software that helps in modeling and predicting potential impacts of climate change on the organization's operations. Additionally, the paragraph details the process of sharing all inherent and residual risks with the GRC and Audit Committee, which shows an integration of climate risk into the overall risk management framework. The mention of assessing property risk annually to project and mitigate possible impacts due to climate change also aligns with the question's interest in procedures for regularly monitoring and updating the organization's understanding of climate-related risks. However, the paragraph does not cover all aspects mentioned in the background information, such as stakeholder engagement processes or detailed scenario analysis exercises.

[Reason]: The paragraph is helpful for answering the question because it mentions the use of the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD) framework and an independent assurance engagement by DNV Business Assurance USA, Inc. This indicates that the organization is at least partially aware of and is taking steps to address climate-related risks, which aligns with the types of information the question is looking for. The mention of the TCFD framework specifically suggests that the organization is engaged in some form of process to identify and assess climate-related risks, even if the details of this process are not provided in the paragraph. The independent assurance engagement also suggests that the organization has a structured approach to managing and reporting on climate-related risks. However, the paragraph does not provide detailed information on the specific processes, tools, or strategies used for this purpose, nor does it cover all aspects of climate risk management such as stakeholder engagement or scenario analysis exercises.

<paragraph>: ""Canada has the world's largest peatland carbon stock, with peatlands covering over 1.1 million square kilometers-an area twice the size of France..

[Reason]: The paragraph does not provide any information about the company's net-zero target or transition plan to reach it. It focuses on the importance of peatlands in climate regulation and the role of the World Conservation Society (WCS) in protecting these carbon sinks. There is no mention of the company's specific goals, strategies, or investments related to reducing greenhouse gas emissions or achieving net-zero emissions by a certain date. Therefore, it does not contribute to answering the question about the company's net-zero target and transition plan.

<paragraph>: ""DAN: Climate change fundamentally threatens our core mission to save wildlife and wild places; we've all seen the harm done by worsening droughts and wildfires. But WCS also brings distinctive strengths to solving this crisis. Forests remain our greatest climate asset; globally, they remove a third of the CO$_{2}$ emitted each year from burning fossil fuels. And most of that removal is done by the kind of high-integrity forests and peatlands WCS field programs help protect.With our on-the-ground presence in more than 50 countries-including thousands of staff working closely with governments and communities-WCS can be a significant piece of the global climate solution. The key is to bring financial investment into conservation in a whole new way. Intact forests keep the planet as much as a degree cooler than it would be without their help.

[Reason]: The paragraph provides information about the company's commitment to decarbonizing and electrifying the world, aiming to achieve zero emissions by 2050. It mentions the company's focus on decarbonizing and electrifying the world, which is relevant to understanding the company's transition plan towards net-zero emissions. The mention of developing long-term ESG goals and making progress towards them indicates an effort to achieve a net-zero target. However, the paragraph does not provide specific details on the target year for achieving net-zero emissions or a detailed list of strategies or actions to be taken to reach this goal. Therefore, while the paragraph is somewhat helpful in showing the company's commitment to a net-zero target and transition plan, it lacks the detailed information required to fully answer the question.

[Reason]: The paragraph is helpful for answering the question because it provides information on the company's commitment to reaching net-zero emissions for its U.S. ISR sites, which directly addresses part of the question regarding a clearly stated net-zero target. It also mentions the company's efforts in measuring greenhouse gas emissions across its operations, developing a decarbonization roadmap, and evaluating new carbon emissions reduction technologies, which are steps towards achieving the net-zero target. However, the paragraph does not provide detailed information on the transition plan or strategies to reach net-zero, such as investments in renewable energy sources, efforts to improve energy efficiency, or initiatives to offset remaining emissions. Therefore, while the paragraph is useful in showing that the company is working towards a net-zero target, it does not fully answer the question as it lacks details on the transition plan.

[Reason]: The paragraph provides detailed information about the company's efforts in developing a climate strategy and transition plan to achieve its goals, including the development of a carbon reduction roadmap and the engagement of both employees and suppliers in data collection and carbon reduction efforts. It mentions the company's commitment to the CDP (Carbon Disclosure Project) and outlines specific actions such as measuring Scope 3 emissions, training key personnel on data collection, and engaging with the supply chain to gather Scope 3 data. These actions align with the types of information the question seeks, such as detailed strategies or actions to reduce direct and indirect greenhouse gas emissions and efforts to engage suppliers in reducing their carbon footprint. However, the paragraph does not specify a net-zero target or a clear year by which this goal is to be achieved, which is a critical piece of information for fully answering the question. Therefore, while the paragraph is helpful in understanding the company's approach to reducing its carbon footprint and engaging in efforts towards a net-zero target, it does not provide a complete answer to the question as it lacks the specific year and the net-zero target itself.

Your job is to assess whether the <paragraph> is useful in answering the <question>.

<background_information>: ""Meaning of the question: The question ""Does the company have a clearly stated net-zero target and a transition plan how to reach it?"" is asking for information about whether the company has publicly committed to achieving net-zero greenhouse gas emissions by a specific date and if they have outlined a detailed strategy or set of actions to achieve this goal. This involves understanding both the target set for reducing emissions to net-zero and the roadmap or measures the company plans to implement to reduce its carbon footprint and offset remaining emissions.

This also applies to the new CO$_{2}$ strategy developed in 2021 and implemented in the reporting year.. The goal in the future is to continue to reduce CO$_{2}$ intensity by an average of 5% per year. As such, Geberit is looking to achieve a long-term reduction in absolute CO$_{2}$ emissions from 183,886 tonnes in 2021 to 121,000 tonnes by 2035. In comparison with the reference year 2015, relative CO$_{2}$ emissions are to be reduced by 70% by 2030 and by 80% by 2035, while absolute CO$_{2}$ emissions are to fall by 47% and 50% by 2030 and 2035 respectively. The targeted reduction in emissions (Scopes 1 and 2) is equivalent to a contribution to a reduction path that limits CO$_{2}$ emissions to 'well below 2°C' above pre-industrial levels.A central element of the new CO$_{2}$ strategy is its integration in all relevant and existing business processes as well as the handling of CO$_{2}$ emissions as external costs by means of internal CO$_{2}$ pricing.""

[Reason]: The paragraph is helpful for answering the question because it provides specific information about the company's net-zero target and transition plan. It mentions the company's commitment to reduce emissions by 46.2% by 2030, which is a clear and stated net-zero target. It also mentions the company's alignment with the Science Based Targets initiative, which indicates a structured approach to achieving the net-zero goal. This information directly addresses parts of the question related to the specific year by which the company aims to achieve net-zero and the detailed strategies or actions the company plans to take to reduce emissions. However, the paragraph does not cover all aspects mentioned in the background information, such as investments in renewable energy sources, efforts to improve energy efficiency, or initiatives to offset remaining emissions. Despite these omissions, the paragraph is still useful in providing insight into the company's net-zero target and transition plan.

[Reason]: The paragraph is helpful for answering the question because it provides specific information about the company's commitment to achieving net-zero emissions by 2050 and outlines a transition plan to achieve this goal. It mentions the introduction of renewable energy and the utilization of hydrogen, as well as the ""Plant Zero CO 2 Emissions Challenge"" aiming for zero CO2 emissions at all plants by 2035. This directly addresses parts of the question related to the net-zero target and the transition plan to reach it. However, it does not provide detailed strategies or actions beyond the target year and the broad mention of working with stakeholders to build social infrastructure for renewable energy. Therefore, while the paragraph is useful in indicating the company's commitment and some aspects of its transition plan, it does not cover all the details mentioned in the background information.

[Reason]: The paragraph is helpful for answering the question because it provides specific information about the company's efforts in reducing its scope 1 and 2 emissions, including details on the types of energy reduction projects completed and the impact on total energy usage and emissions intensity. However, it does not provide detailed information on the company's scope 3 emissions, which are the indirect emissions that are not produced by the company itself but are associated with its activities from sources that it does not own or control. The information on scope 3 emissions is limited to a total amount of 1,503,000 metric tons CO$_{2}$e without any breakdown or details on the specific sources of these emissions. Therefore, while the paragraph is somewhat helpful in understanding the company's overall approach to reducing its carbon footprint and provides a glimpse into the total scope 3 emissions, it does not offer the detailed information required to fully answer the question about the scope 3 emissions breakdown.

This directly relates to the company's efforts in managing its direct emissions (Scope 1 and 2), which are part of the information sought in the question. However, the paragraph does not provide any information on the company's indirect emissions (Scope 3), such as emissions from the use of sold products and services, waste generated in operations, or emissions from investments in projects outside of the company's direct operations.

[Reason]: The paragraph provides information about the scope of the report, including the organizational boundary and the methods of calculating emissions for both direct and indirect emissions (Scope 1 and Scope 3). It mentions the third-party verification of Scope 3 emissions, indicating that the data is accurate and includes emissions from sources other than the company's direct operations. This directly addresses part of the question regarding what Scope 3 says, as it indicates that the report includes information on indirect emissions that are not produced by the company itself but are associated with its activities. However, the paragraph does not provide specific details on the types of indirect emissions included in Scope 3, such as emissions from the production of purchased materials or the use of sold products and services. It only mentions the general category of ""Other Indirect Emissions"" and the verification of data for a specific year.

[Reason]: The provided paragraph does not contain any information related to the company's scope 3 emissions, which are indirect emissions that are not produced by the company itself but are associated with its activities from sources that it does not own or control. Instead, the paragraph focuses on the company's general information, its business model, and its subsidiaries. It does not mention any of the examples of information that the question is looking for, such as emissions from the transportation of raw materials, the manufacturing of products, or waste generation in operations.

<question>: ""what the scope 3 says?""
<paragraph>: ""As a community builder Peab has broad and diversified operations. We are active in four Nordic countries with an extensive geographic presence as well as customers in both the private and public sectors. Our four business areas Construction, Civil Engineering, Industry and Project Development are independent but ensure through collaboration that we utilize local resources as far as possible in the form of our own personnel and input goods. In other words, Peab's business comprises many different kinds of activities that come under the EU taxonomy. At the same time Peab's operations are characterized by further conditions that provide the framework for how our reporting according to the EU taxonomy should be understood. Our operations are primarily carried out as projects where every project is unique, which makes evaluating each project demanding. In our construction and civil engineering operations customers by and large formulate the specifications of the project. This reduces Peab's ability to influence the outcome, even if we work actively with holding dialogues with customers early on. In addition, lead times are long in the industry-from zoning to completed project-and therefore it takes years before new requirements are realized in operations and reporting.""

[Reason]: The paragraph does not provide specific information about the indirect emissions that are part of Scope 3 emissions as defined by the Greenhouse Gas Protocol. It focuses on the company's business areas, geographic presence, and the uniqueness of each project, which does not directly address the question of what Scope 3 emissions are or how they are measured. The information is more about the company's general operations and does not offer details on emissions from the company's value chain, customer specifications, or any other direct or indirect activities that would contribute to Scope 3 emissions.

<paragraph>: ""The criteria for DNSH have been evaluated and Peab's ECO-products are considered to meet them.· Climate change adaptation: Considered met because we have performed climate risk and vulnerability analyses for all the manufacturing units of ECO-products and identified possible risk redu cing measures.· The sustainable use and protection of water and marine resources: Considered met because of compliance with valid laws since water activities and other situations that affect environment quality norms for water always require an Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) and taking relevant safeguards.· The transition to a circular economy: Considered met because Peab applies the industry's guidelines for waste management that steer towards sorting for possible material recycling. Peab also regularly evaluates the possibility of circular material flows concerning both input raw material for production and the recyclability of manufactured products. Examples of this are the binder Merit, based on slag which is a byproduct from the steel industry, our ECO-Ballast (ECO-Mineral aggregates) which is based on 100 percent reused raw material and is used in concrete and asphalt as well as reclaimed asphalt pavement as raw material in our paving production. There are EPDs for all our ECO-products.""

[Reason]: The paragraph is somewhat helpful for answering the question because it mentions the company's efforts in identifying the boundaries of Scopes 1, 2, and 3 in relation to their environmental impact and mentions the initial disclosures of their Scope 3 Business Travel figures for 2022. This indicates an effort to understand and report on indirect emissions associated with the company's activities, which is directly relevant to the question about what Scope 3 says. However, the paragraph does not provide detailed information on the specific types of indirect emissions (e.g., emissions from the manufacturing of products by suppliers, waste generated in operations, etc.) or the full scope of activities that contribute to their Scope 3 emissions. Therefore, while the paragraph is a step towards understanding the company's Scope 3 emissions, it does not fully answer the question but rather indicates a direction towards a more complete answer.

<question>: ""what the scope 3 says?""
<paragraph>: ""A wide range of measures for saving energy and increasing efficiency are planned at the plants. Accordingly, the area of ceramics, which accounts for around two-thirds of all Geberit's CO$_{2}$ emissions, has the largest structural savings potential. This includes a special focus on the reduction of scrap rates. The firing process and the use of the resulting waste heat will be further optimised. This can be used for other process steps, such as drying the cast plaster moulds or ceramic blanks. Furthermore, projects were launched to investigate the possibilities of switching to renewable energy sources-for example, ecologically produced hydrogen-in the long term as well as the systematic reuse of ceramic waste.Fuel consumption is determined primarily by the company's own and leased fleet of cars and delivery vans. Since early 2008, binding guidelines have also applied for the purchase of new vehicles. As of 2019, these guidelines were adjusted to take into account the new Worldwide Harmonised Light Vehicles Test Procedure (WLTP).""

[Reason]: The paragraph provided does not directly address the question regarding the scope 3 emissions of the company. Instead, it focuses on the company's efforts to save energy and increase efficiency within its operations, including specific measures such as reducing scrap rates and switching to renewable energy sources. While these measures are related to the company's operations and could indirectly impact its scope 1 and scope 2 emissions, they do not provide information on the indirect emissions that are the focus of scope 3. The information is more about the company's internal actions and investments rather than the emissions associated with its value chain or activities that it does not own or control.

The  Panel Statement confirms Geberit's perception-often expressed both internally and externally-that Geberit products are crucial for the added value of the company. Additionally, customers and other stakeholders are increasingly focusing on environmental and sustainability performance. The efficient handling of water remains one of the most important topics at Geberit. Saving water is directly linked to reducing energy consumption, which in turn indirectly reduces CO$_{2}$ emissions in the product use phase. The company has emphasised this link for years with reference to the  water footprint. Accordingly, Geberit's most significant contribution to climate change mitigation is then through water-saving solutions. An example of this is the new Acanto WC system solution with TurboFlush technology, which also features an extremely quiet flush and requires minimal cleaning.""

<paragraph>: ""Implementation of targets and measures together with plant management* EHS: Environment, Health and SafetyThe  Corporate Governance report included in the Annual Report 2022 contains further information on the governance structure.2. StrategyAccording to TCFD guidelines, a distinction is made between physical risks and transitional risks and opportunities. Material risks and their financial significance are regularly reviewed and assessed by Geberit as part of risk management.Physical risks include short-term acute, extreme weather events and longer-term chronic, localised effects such as increasing average temperatures, rising sea levels or increasing periods of drought. These short-term and longer-term effects may result in damage to property and infrastructure, adversely affect logistics operations or cause disruptions in the supply chain. Rising average temperatures and an increase in the number of hot days lead to increased energy demand for the cooling of machines, processes and workplaces during the summer months, as well as to a possible reduction in energy demand for heating buildings in the winter. Rising sea levels may mean that production sites located on the sea have to be protected against flooding.""

OVS has defined Scope 3 emissionreduction targets on categories that are particularly relevant and where there is significant scope for action.As can be seen from the following table, thanks to an improved raw materials portfolio with a greater selection of low-impact materials and the reduction in the incidence of shipments by air, Scope 3 emissions decreased by 11% compared to 2019, substantially in line with the target of 12.6% defined by the objectives approved by SBTi. Considering the reduction per kg of product, the reduction is 12%.The significant reduction in transport emissions comes from the almost complete elimination of air transport. The slight upward shift from 2021 in emissions related to purchased Goods and Services should be read in light of the fact that in 2022, some purchases of finished goods were brought forward compared to the normal procurement curve typically adopted.""

[Reason]: The paragraph is helpful for answering the question because it provides specific information about the company's efforts in reducing Scope 3 emissions, including the percentage of reduction and the specific actions taken to achieve this (e.g., the improved raw materials portfolio and the reduction in air transport). This directly addresses several examples of information the question is looking for, such as emissions from the transportation of raw materials and the use of sold products and services (in this case, the reduction in air transport). However, the paragraph does not cover all aspects of Scope 3 emissions, such as emissions from the manufacturing of products by suppliers or waste generated in operations. Despite this, it still provides valuable information that contributes to understanding the company's approach to managing its indirect emissions.

[Reason]: The paragraph is helpful for answering the question because it mentions the company's efforts in completing a scope 3 screening, which is directly related to identifying and understanding indirect emissions associated with the company's activities. It specifically mentions the category of ""Purchased goods and services"" as part of the scope 3 analysis, which is relevant to the question as it seeks information about emissions from the company's value chain and supply chain.

Instead, it focuses on the company's efforts in reducing Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions, such as replacing aging equipment with energy-efficient alternatives, installing LED lighting in parking garages, and using energy-efficient lighting and motion sensors in offices and hallways. It also mentions the company's commitment to environmental principles and has a general statement about the importance of conducting business in an environmentally responsible manner.

[Reason]: The paragraph is helpful for answering the question because it mentions that Peab reports on ""parts of Scope 3"" emissions, which directly addresses the first part of the question regarding the categories of Scope 3 emissions the company reports. It also indicates that the company has set a long-term environmental target of climate neutrality by 2045 and uses measurements to monitor this target achievement and climate impact, which indirectly relates to the question by showing the company's commitment to tracking and managing its emissions. However, the paragraph does not provide specific details on the methodology used to calculate Scope 3 emissions, the total calculated Scope 3 emissions for the reporting period, or any significant changes in Scope 3 emissions categories or percentages compared to previous reporting periods. Therefore, while the paragraph is somewhat helpful in understanding the company's approach to Scope 3 emissions and its long-term goals, it does not fully answer the question.

<background_information>: ""Meaning of the question: The question ""What categories of Scope 3 emissions does the company report, and what percentage of total emissions for the reporting period are Scope 3?"" is asking for detailed information about the indirect emissions that occur in a company's value chain, which are not directly produced by the company's own operations or energy consumption (unlike Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions). Specifically, it seeks to understand which specific categories of these indirect emissions (Scope 3) are being tracked and reported by the company, and how significant these emissions are in comparison to the company's total greenhouse gas emissions during the specified reporting period.

Examples of information that the question is looking for:
1. A breakdown of Scope 3 emission sources, such as emissions from purchased goods and services, business travel, employee commuting, waste generated in operations, use of sold products, and end-of-life treatment of sold products.
2. The methodology used by the company to calculate or estimate Scope 3 emissions in each reported category.
3. The total calculated Scope 3 emissions for the reporting period and the percentage this represents of the company's overall greenhouse gas emissions.

[Reason]: The provided paragraph does not contain any information related to the company's Scope 3 emissions or any details about the company's indirect emissions that occur in its value chain. It focuses on the organization's efforts in conservation, such as the Conservation Patrons program and naming opportunities at wildlife parks. There is no mention of the company's Scope 3 emissions categories, the methodology for calculating these emissions, the total calculated Scope 3 emissions for the reporting period, changes in Scope 3 emissions compared to previous periods, initiatives to reduce Scope 3 emissions, or goals for future reductions in Scope 3 emissions.

[Reason]: The paragraph provides information about the company's efforts in sustainable product design and supply chain management, which are relevant to understanding the company's approach to Scope 3 emissions. It mentions the use of sustainable materials and the optimization of transport routes as ways to reduce emissions in the value chain. However, it does not provide a detailed breakdown of the categories of Scope 3 emissions the company reports or the percentage of total emissions that these represent. Therefore, while the paragraph indicates an interest in and actions towards reducing Scope 3 emissions, it does not directly answer the question regarding the specific categories of Scope 3 emissions reported and their percentage of total emissions.

[Reason]: The paragraph is helpful for answering the question because it mentions the company's efforts in assessing and reducing its Scope 1 and Scope 2 greenhouse gas emissions, including a specific mention of a 19% reduction in Scope 1 and 2 emissions in fiscal 2022 compared to the fiscal 2018 baseline. It also indicates that the company plans to assess its Scope 3 emissions in the future. This information is relevant to understanding the company's approach to managing and reporting on its indirect emissions, which are part of the Scope 3 category. However, the paragraph does not provide detailed information on the categories of Scope 3 emissions the company reports or the percentage of total emissions for the reporting period that are Scope 3. It also does not mention any specific initiatives or strategies the company has implemented to reduce its Scope 3 emissions or any goals or targets set for future reductions in Scope 3 emissions. Therefore, while the paragraph is somewhat helpful in indicating the company's awareness and action towards Scope 3 emissions, it does not fully answer the question regarding the specific categories of Scope 3 emissions and their percentage of total emissions for the reporting period.

[Reason]: The paragraph is helpful for answering the question because it specifically mentions the categories of Scope 3 emissions that the company reports, which include ""purchased goods and services,"" ""capital goods,"" ""upstream transportation and distribution,"" and ""business travel."" This directly addresses part of the question regarding the categories of Scope 3 emissions the company reports. However, it does not provide information on the total percentage of emissions that are Scope 3, nor does it discuss any changes in these categories or percentages compared to previous reporting periods, initiatives to reduce these emissions, or future goals for reduction. Therefore, while the paragraph is useful in providing insight into the company's reporting of Scope 3 emissions categories, it only partially answers the question.

[Reason]: The paragraph provides information that partially answers the question by indicating that the company has identified and disclosed initial figures for its Scope 3 emissions related to business travel for the year 2022. This directly addresses part of the question regarding the categories of Scope 3 emissions the company reports. However, it does not provide a complete answer as it lacks details on the other categories of Scope 3 emissions (e.g., emissions from purchased goods and services, waste generated in operations, etc.), the total calculated Scope 3 emissions for the reporting period, or the percentage of total emissions that these represent. Therefore, while the paragraph is helpful in showing that the company is tracking and reporting some Scope 3 emissions, it does not offer a comprehensive view of the company's Scope 3 emissions reporting or the significant impact these emissions have on the total emissions for the reporting period.

[Reason]: The provided paragraph does not contain any information related to the categories of Scope 3 emissions that the company reports or the percentage of total emissions for the reporting period that are Scope 3. Instead, it focuses on the company's efforts in various areas such as information disclosures, stakeholder engagement, and environmental management practices. It mentions the TCFD recommendations and a review of the Toyota Environmental Action Plan but does not provide specific details on Scope 3 emissions or related data. Therefore, it does not help in answering the question about the company's reporting of Scope 3 emissions or the percentage of total emissions that are Scope 3.

[Reason]: The paragraph provides information on how Toyota reviews its strategy based on climate-related risks and opportunities, indicating an approach to managing these factors. It mentions the use of the Toyota Global Risk Management Standard (TGRS) to identify risks and set priorities, which is a process that could include setting specific targets or metrics to understand, quantify, and benchmark climate-related risks and opportunities. However, the paragraph does not explicitly list or detail the specific targets or metrics that Toyota is using, nor does it provide information on the organization's performance against these targets. Therefore, while the paragraph suggests a framework that could include targets related to climate, it does not directly answer the question regarding the specific targets or the organization's performance against them.

[Reason]: The paragraph provides a general overview of the organization's commitment to environmental, social, and governance (ESG) initiatives, including sustainability and other public policy matters. It mentions the existence of an ESG steering group that governs the company's commitment to these areas, including the environment. However, it does not specify any targets or metrics related to climate-related risks and opportunities, nor does it provide any information on the organization's performance against these targets. Therefore, while it indicates an organizational structure that could potentially support the setting and monitoring of such targets, it does not directly answer the question regarding specific targets and the organization's performance against them.

[Reason]: The paragraph is helpful for answering the question because it provides specific information on the organization's targets and progress related to understanding, quantifying, and benchmarking climate-related risks and opportunities. It mentions the organization's transition to 100% renewable-sourced energy in one of its facilities, the installation of solar panels and an Intelligent Energy Management System, and the expansion of data collection to include Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions, with plans to expand to Scope 3 emissions in the future. These actions indicate a clear target and progress towards reducing carbon emissions, which is a key aspect of managing climate-related risks. Additionally, the mention of submitting an annual CDP response and embedding critical feedback into the enterprise risk-assessment processes shows a strategic approach to managing climate risks and opportunities. The paragraph also touches on the organization's efforts in ethical sourcing, which can be seen as a component of broader social and environmental impact goals that are often related to climate change mitigation and adaptation strategies.

[Reason]: The paragraph is helpful for answering the question because it provides information on the organization's efforts to understand, quantify, and benchmark climate-related risks and opportunities. It mentions the existence of a Carbon Management Program with future plans for reduction of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, which directly addresses the first part of the question regarding the targets the organization uses for this purpose. Additionally, it highlights the organization's progress in managing and quantifying its exposure to climate risk by disclosing its score in the CDP Climate Change questionnaire and indicating plans to collect data on Scope 3 emissions. This information is relevant to understanding the organization's performance against its climate-related targets and its approach to managing these risks.

[Reason]: The paragraph provided does not directly address the question regarding the organization's specific targets for understanding, quantifying, and benchmarking climate-related risks and opportunities, nor does it detail the organization's performance against these targets. Instead, it focuses on a collaborative effort by the WCS and the Doris Duke Charitable Foundation to support climate adaptation projects across the United States. While it highlights the organization's involvement in climate adaptation efforts, it does not offer any information on the organization's internal goals or progress in meeting them. Therefore, it does not provide the specific information sought in the question about the organization's climate-related targets and their performance.

<paragraph>: ""It is well known that we need to drastically reduce our dependence on fossil fuels in order to achieve the goal of limiting global warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius. But there is less awareness that we have natural solutions to the climate crisis available right now. For example, the earth's forests sponge up 30 percent of the carbon dioxide we release into the atmosphere each year-and they will keep doing this work for us if we make sure they are not cut down.In this section, you can read about how WCS is leading global efforts to advance nature-positive solutions to the climate crisis-from protecting the forests of the Congo Basin, the largest tropical net carbon sink on Earth, to conserving the peatlands of boreal Canada, which store even more carbon than intact forests. And since some of the effects of climate change are unavoidable, WCS is also working to help wildlife, ecosystems, and communities adapt to changing conditions.""

[Reason]: The paragraph is helpful for answering the question because it mentions the organization's specific target to reach carbon neutrality by 2040. This directly addresses part of the question regarding the specific targets the organization uses to understand, quantify, and benchmark climate-related risks and opportunities. The mention of this target indicates the organization's commitment to addressing climate change and its impact, which is a key aspect of the question. However, the paragraph does not provide detailed information on the organization's performance against this target or any other specific goals related to carbon emission reduction, renewable energy usage, water usage reduction, biodiversity initiatives, financial investments in climate resilience, low-carbon product development, employee engagement in sustainability, external stakeholder collaboration on climate issues, or the use of climate scenario analysis. Therefore, while the paragraph is useful in showing the organization's commitment to climate action and a specific target (carbon neutrality by 2040), it does not provide a comprehensive answer to the question as it lacks detailed information on the organization's performance against these targets.

It has also helped to identify emissions hot spots in our supply chain and provide a complete baseline for measuring the impact of supply chain decarbonization initiatives over time.

[Reason]: The paragraph provides information on the organization's efforts in assessing and managing climate-related risks, specifically mentioning the completion of a scope 3 screening to understand the impact of emissions in the supply chain. This action is directly related to the question's interest in how the organization is understanding, quantifying, and benchmarking climate-related risks. The mention of decarbonization opportunities within the supply chain and the identification of emissions hot spots directly addresses the first two examples of information the question is looking for, which are specific carbon emission reduction targets and the progress made towards achieving these targets. However, the paragraph does not provide information on the organization's overall climate-related targets or how it is performing against all of them, which means it partially answers the question but does not fully cover all aspects of the organization's efforts in this area.

[Reason]: The paragraph provides information on the organization's sustainability strategy, including the use of tools like the B Impact Assessment and the SDG Action Manager, and mentions the formalization of the commitment to fighting climate change within the 'Products and Supply chain' and 'Sustainable stores' pillars. It also indicates the initiation of a risk assessment process according to TCFD recommendations, which is relevant to understanding and managing climate-related risks. However, the paragraph does not specify any specific targets or metrics related to climate change mitigation or opportunities, such as carbon emission reduction goals, renewable energy usage targets, or any other examples listed in the background information. Therefore, while the paragraph indicates an effort towards understanding and managing climate-related risks, it lacks detailed information on the organization's specific targets and progress towards them.

[Reason]: The paragraph provides information on the organization's internal CO$_{2}$ pricing strategy, which is a mechanism for understanding, quantifying, and benchmarking climate-related risks and opportunities. It mentions the use of a CO$_{2}$ reference price based on the European Emissions Trading System (ETS) and the calculation of an implicit CO$_{2}$ project price for each project. This indicates an approach to managing and investing in activities that reduce CO$_{2}$ emissions, which directly addresses part of the question regarding the organization's targets for understanding and managing climate-related risks and opportunities. However, the paragraph does not provide specific information on the organization's progress or performance in achieving these targets, nor does it cover other aspects of climate-related targets such as renewable energy usage, water usage reduction, biodiversity initiatives, financial investments in resilience, or employee engagement in sustainability. Therefore, while the paragraph is somewhat helpful in understanding the organization's approach to climate-related risks and opportunities, it does not fully answer the question as it lacks data on the organization's performance against these targets.

And most of that removal is done by the kind of high-integrity forests and peatlands WCS field programs help protect.With our on-the-ground presence in more than 50 countries-including thousands of staff working closely with governments and communities-WCS can be a significant piece of the global climate solution. The key is to bring financial investment into conservation in a whole new way. Intact forests keep the planet as much as a degree cooler than it would be without their help. If we value that natural climate control-which is worth tens of trillions of dollars to the global economy-we can create sustainable protections for these vital ecosystems, the wildlife they shelter, and the climate itself.""

It's clear that we are in no way separate from nature. Whether in the most remote regions or in the heart of a city, we are all linked to one another and to our animal relatives. We are mutually dependent. Africa's forest elephants, for instance, are like gardeners: they weed out smaller brush, which allows big trees to get bigger, locking away carbon.

[Reason]: The paragraph provides a general overview of the company's commitment to environmental sustainability and mentions their efforts in advancing the decarbonization of the electric sector and supporting the electrification of the vehicle fleet. It also references the company's EHS (Environmental, Health, and Safety) Policy and their aim to integrate EHS into their business planning and decision making. However, it does not provide specific information on the company's various carbon strategies, such as the use of biofuels, the acquisition and use of carbon credits, or the implementation of carbon removal techniques. It also does not mention any details on the types of verified carbon credits the company prefers or how much they have used. Therefore, while the paragraph indicates a general commitment to environmental sustainability, it does not offer the detailed information on carbon strategies and the use of verified carbon credits that the question seeks.

[Reason]: The provided paragraph does not contain any information related to the company's carbon strategies, such as biofuel use, carbon credit acquisition, carbon removal techniques, or any details on the types of verified carbon credits the company prefers or how much it has used. Instead, it focuses on the company's alignment with the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals and mentions a specific formula for calculating CO$_{2}$ emissions but does not offer any insights into the company's internal carbon reduction efforts or strategies. Therefore, it does not address the question directly or provide the necessary information to answer it fully.

[Reason]: The paragraph provides information on HARMAN's commitment to climate change and its efforts to integrate climate priorities into strategic decision-making. It mentions the company's Climate Targets, including a commitment to achieve carbon neutrality by 2040 across all scopes of emissions, which aligns with the company's overall sustainability goals and international commitments like the Paris Agreement. However, the paragraph does not offer detailed information on specific carbon strategies such as biofuel use, carbon credit strategies, or carbon removal projects. It lacks data on the types of verified carbon credits the company prefers and how much it has used these credits, which are critical to fully answering the question. Therefore, while the paragraph indicates a general direction towards sustainability and carbon neutrality, it does not provide the specific details on carbon strategies and the use of verified carbon credits that the question seeks.

[Reason]: The paragraph provides information on the use of an Enterprise Risk Management (ERM) tool to identify and assess various types of risks, including those related to climate change. It mentions the tool's ability to provide both qualitative and quantitative feedback on risks across different categories, including those directly affected by climate change such as severe weather events. This directly addresses part of the question regarding the tools or instruments used to manage climate risks. However, the paragraph does not provide detailed information on specific methods, technologies, strategies, or frameworks beyond the ERM tool itself. It does not mention any other specific tools or instruments used to manage climate risks as outlined in the background information, such as an Environmental Management System (EMS), the TCFD framework, climate scenario planning exercises, investment in renewable energy, or other specific risk management techniques related to climate change.

But there is less awareness that we have natural solutions to the climate crisis available right now. For example, the earth's forests sponge up 30 percent of the carbon dioxide we release into the atmosphere each year-and they will keep doing this work for us if we make sure they are not cut down.In this section, you can read about how WCS is leading global efforts to advance nature-positive solutions to the climate crisis-from protecting the forests of the Congo Basin, the largest tropical net carbon sink on Earth, to conserving the peatlands of boreal Canada, which store even more carbon than intact forests. And since some of the effects of climate change are unavoidable, WCS is also working to help wildlife, ecosystems, and communities adapt to changing conditions.""

[Reason]: The paragraph provides information about Toyota's approach to managing all types of risks, including climate change, through its company-wide risk management system called the TGRS (Toyota Global Risk System). It mentions the process of identifying and assessing risks based on the TGRS, which includes a comprehensive analysis of the 'magnitude of impact' and 'vulnerabilities' to the business. This process is designed to clarify the financial or strategic impact of risks on the business. While the paragraph does not explicitly mention specific tools or instruments used to manage climate risks, such as climate risk assessment software or a specific financial instrument for hedging against climate variability, it does indicate a structured approach to risk management that includes climate change. This could be relevant to understanding the broader context of how Toyota manages climate risks, even if it does not provide detailed information on specific tools or instruments.

[Reason]: The paragraph is helpful for answering the question because it provides specific information about the tools and instruments the organization is using to manage climate risks. It mentions the completion of a Scope 1 and 2 GHG emissions assessment in collaboration with a third-party vendor using the GHG Protocol, which is a well-known and widely used framework for quantifying and reporting greenhouse gas emissions. This action is directly related to the first example of information the question is looking for, which is the use of climate risk assessment software to identify and quantify the potential impacts of various climate scenarios on the company's operations. Additionally, the mention of setting long-range goals to further reduce Scope 1 and 2 carbon emissions and assessing Scope 3 emissions indicates an approach to managing and reducing the company's impact on the environment, which aligns with several other examples of tools and instruments for managing climate risks, such as the implementation of an Environmental Management System (EMS) and the development of a climate resilience strategy.

[Reason]: The paragraph is helpful for answering the question because it provides specific examples of tools and instruments the organization is using to manage climate risks. It mentions the installation of solar panels and an Intelligent Energy Management System, which are actions that reduce the company's carbon footprint and contribute to a more sustainable operation. Additionally, the expansion of data collection processes to include Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions, and the intention to expand this to Scope 3 emissions, shows a strategic approach to understanding and managing the company's impact on the environment. The submission of an annual CDP response indicates a commitment to transparency and accountability in climate risk management. Furthermore, the embedding of critical feedback into the existing enterprise risk-assessment processes suggests a structured approach to managing climate risks as part of the overall risk management strategy of the company. These details align with several examples of information the question is looking for, such as investment in renewable energy projects and energy efficiency measures, development of a climate resilience strategy, and collaboration with non-governmental organizations on projects aimed at ecosystem restoration and conservation.

[Reason]: The provided paragraph does not contain any information related to the company's strategy for transitioning towards sustainability or any projections about how this shift will impact its financial health and performance over time. Instead, it focuses on the company's internal employee recognition and mental health support initiatives. While these initiatives are important for employee well-being and can contribute to a positive work environment, they do not address the financial implications of adopting sustainability objectives and priorities as outlined in the background information. Therefore, the paragraph does not help in answering the question about the financial performance of the company in relation to its sustainability transition strategy.

[Reason]: The paragraph provides a general overview of the company's financial position, including details on sales, production starts, cash flow, and investments in ECO-products and acquisitions. It also mentions the company's strategic targets and external targets for the year 2022. However, it does not contain any specific information on how the company expects its financial performance to change over time in relation to its strategy for achieving sustainability objectives and priorities. The information is more about the current state of the company's finances and does not offer any projections or analysis of investment requirements for sustainability projects, risk assessments related to the sustainability transition, or any details on funding sources for sustainability efforts. Therefore, while the paragraph gives a glimpse into the company's current financial health and some of its strategic goals, it does not directly answer the question regarding the impact of the transition plan on financial performance over time.

<paragraph>: ""Accidents and days lost (GRI 403-9) The manufacture of sanitary products can generally be said to have a low level of risks at the workplace. Nevertheless, there are still some individual activities which entail an increased risk of accidents. Typical workplace risks are the lifting and carrying of heavy loads, working at heights and in noisy environments, as well as handling hot surfaces and hazardous substances. As part of the Geberit Safety System, the workplace risks are assessed systematically and appropriate measures implemented to protect the employees. Geberit is consistently pursuing the creation of safe and clean workstations at the production plants. This is carried out, for example, by optimising and modernising the systems and processes (e.g. an appliance for deburring sharp sheet edges when manufacturing installation modules), the replacement of hazardous substances (e.g. substitution of the pickling process in the manufacture of metal fittings) and the reduction of dust and noise emissions (e.g. by using more efficient extraction devices and filters in ceramic production). Workstations are also being further optimised from an ergonomic point of view through the increasing use of robots or lifting aids.""

[Reason]: The paragraph provided focuses on the company's efforts in conserving water and the implementation of energy recovery units to save energy and reduce maintenance costs. While these actions demonstrate a commitment to environmental conservation and operational efficiency, they do not directly address the social contributions or efforts mentioned in the background information. The information is more about the company's internal operations and resource management rather than its social responsibilities or efforts to benefit the community or address social issues. Therefore, the paragraph does not provide useful information for answering the question about the social contributions or efforts of the company.

[Reason]: The paragraph provided does not offer specific information about the social contributions or efforts mentioned by the company. It focuses on the technical aspects of the Making Progress program, which is a system for improving environmental and social impact data of suppliers. While it mentions support and financial assistance to suppliers for corrective actions, it does not detail any social contributions or efforts directly by the company itself. The information is more about the company's internal and external support systems for improving supplier performance rather than the company's own social initiatives or programs.

[Reason]: The paragraph provides information on the social contributions or efforts the company has implemented to improve employee well-being and provide support in their personal lives. It mentions initiatives like offering discounted access to local gyms, partnering with Weight Watchers for discounted membership, and providing various onsite services and consumer discounts. These actions align with the types of social contributions the question is looking for, such as programs designed to improve employee well-being and contributions to economic development in the communities where the company operates. However, the paragraph does not cover a wide range of social contributions, such as community development projects, environmental conservation efforts, or efforts to promote diversity, equity, and inclusion. Therefore, while the paragraph is somewhat helpful in answering the question by providing examples of the company's social contributions, it does not fully address the question as it lacks information on a broader range of social efforts.

Yet our five urban wildlife parks have come back from these challenges stronger. The aquarium is now fully reopened, with new exhibits that connect visitors to the wonders of marine life in the New York Seascape and beyond. Last year we welcomed more than 3.5 million guests to our four zoos and aquarium in New York City, offering new experiences and family favorites like the Bronx Zoo's World of Birds, which is celebrating its 50th anniversary.""

When it comes to biodiversity management, we are guided by local regulations, with a commitment to minimizing our disturbance of the local biodiversity. The ISR method we currently use results in significantly less land disturbance than underground or open pit mining. Therefore, our operational footprint in Texas and Wyoming is quite small compared to conventional mining. This is primarily due to the lack of tailings produced in the ISR process compared to conventional mining. Tailings facilities, which hold radioactive material, are often tens of acres in size and must be maintained indefinitely. ISR contains no tailings and, therefore, does not require this additional land. Further, none of our permitted sites are in or near areas that hold protected conservation status or endangered species habitat, according to U.S. federal guidelines.""

To address this challenge, TPI has focused much of our wind technology efforts on the emerging field of computer vision and laser measurement with the use of artificial intelligence data processing to provide real-time feedback of key production metrics and collection of historical data.

[Reason]: The paragraph provides information on the organization's efforts in responsible sourcing, sustainable design and manufacturing, and energy optimization within its operations. It mentions the use of the Responsible Business Alliance (RBA) Standards for due diligence procedures, the implementation of sustainable packaging and logistics practices, and the use of energy optimization techniques.

[Reason]: The paragraph provides information on the organization's approach to understanding and engaging with stakeholders on sustainability issues, including the use of a materiality assessment to identify key environmental, social, and governance topics. This process is a step towards assessing climate-related risks and opportunities, as it helps the organization understand the areas where it should focus its efforts to align with its strategy and risk management process. However, the paragraph does not provide specific metrics or indicators used in the assessment process itself, such as carbon footprint measurements, water usage efficiency metrics, energy efficiency indicators, waste management metrics, or any other specific sustainability metrics mentioned in the background information. Therefore, while the paragraph indicates an effort towards understanding and managing sustainability issues, it does not directly answer the question regarding the specific metrics used for this purpose.

[Reason]: The paragraph does not provide specific information on the metrics the organization uses to assess climate-related risks and opportunities. It focuses on the challenges of building a new supply chain for an innovative product, the impact of the company's production on the local economy and employment opportunities, and the company's commitment to being fair and transparent in its operations. While it mentions the company's efforts in sustainability, such as the production of garments in a way that benefits local communities and the environment, it does not mention any specific metrics or indicators that are used to measure or track these efforts. Therefore, it does not directly answer the question regarding the use of specific metrics for assessing climate-related risks and opportunities and how these metrics align with the organization's strategy and risk management process.

[Reason]: The paragraph provides information on the organization's efforts in sustainability through the Operational Excellence Program, which has contributed to overall reductions in greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and energy consumption. It mentions the relocation of manufacturing operations to a new Center of Excellence in Clinton, Pennsylvania, that incorporates environmentally-focused features like smart controls on HVAC systems and a recycled compressor heat system. This indicates that the organization is using some metrics to measure and improve its environmental impact, such as energy efficiency and GHG emissions reduction. However, the paragraph does not explicitly mention specific metrics or how these metrics are used to assess climate-related risks and opportunities or how they align with the organization's strategy and risk management process. It also does not cover other important aspects of climate-related risk and opportunity assessment, such as water usage efficiency, waste management, supply chain sustainability, climate risk exposure indices, biodiversity impact metrics, employee and community engagement scores, and financial performance metrics linked to sustainability. Therefore, while the paragraph is somewhat relevant as it shows the organization's commitment to sustainability and some of the measures it has taken, it does not provide a comprehensive view of the metrics used to assess climate-related risks and opportunities or how these align with the organization's strategy and risk management process.

<paragraph>: ""18 UEC 2022 Sustainability Report NYSE:  UEC Message from the CEO FY22 Highlights About UEC Our ESG Strategy Governance Environment Social ESG Performance Water Management Water is a critical component for our operations, and therefore, responsibly managing water is crucial to our business. UEC expects our management team, employees and contractors to be good stewards of the water we use in all phases of our operations, from exploration to restoration. Our operational sites do not face any withdrawal or scarcity risks and do not operate in regions with High or Extremely High Baseline Water Stress. All of our ISR projects use ore-hosted groundwater that does not meet primary or secondary drinking water standards and should only be used for industry. Our goal is to restore the orehosted groundwater back to pre-mining concentrations of metals, metalloids, cations and anions and total dissolved solids. To do this, we use reverse osmosis ('RO'), a water purification process that uses pressurized membranes to separate ions, unwanted molecules and larger particles from affected water. After processing through the RO unit, the treated water-roughly 75 percent of the groundwater used-is returned to the affected aquifer through injection wells.""

[Reason]: The paragraph provides information on the organization's efforts in water management, including the use of reverse osmosis (RO) to purify water and the goal of restoring groundwater to pre-mining concentrations. This information is relevant to the question as it demonstrates the organization's specific measures to manage and conserve water resources, which is a critical aspect of environmental sustainability and can be considered a metric for assessing climate-related risks and opportunities. However, the paragraph does not cover a comprehensive range of metrics related to climate change, such as carbon footprint measurement, energy efficiency indicators, waste management metrics, or alignment with international sustainability standards. Therefore, while the paragraph is somewhat helpful in showing the organization's approach to a specific aspect of environmental sustainability, it does not fully answer the question regarding the full range of metrics used for assessing climate-related risks and opportunities and how these metrics align with the organization's strategy and risk management process.

[Reason]: The provided paragraph does not contain information related to the organization's resilience to climate-related scenarios or its strategy in managing climate physical risks. Instead, it focuses on the company's community engagement and social responsibility efforts, including interventions in communities, educational campaigns, and the provision of medical supplies and food kits. While community engagement and social responsibility are important aspects of a company's overall strategy, the paragraph does not address the organization's preparedness for future climate conditions or its strategies to manage climate risks. Therefore, it does not provide the specific information required to answer the question about the organization's resilience to climate scenarios or physical risks.

[Reason]: The paragraph provides information on the organization's efforts to reduce energy usage and emissions, which are relevant to understanding its resilience to climate change. It mentions specific projects completed to reduce energy usage and the impact of these actions on total energy usage and emissions. This information is aligned with the organization's short-term and long-term strategies to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, as outlined in the background information. However, the paragraph does not directly address the organization's strategy in considering different climate-related scenarios, including a 2°C target or lower scenario, or how it plans to manage and mitigate physical climate risks. It does not cover aspects such as scenario planning exercises, risk assessments, engagement with stakeholders on climate resilience, or plans for adapting to physical climate risks. Therefore, while the paragraph is somewhat helpful in understanding the organization's efforts towards reducing its carbon footprint, it does not provide a comprehensive view of the organization's resilience to climate change across all aspects of the question.

[Reason]: The provided paragraph does not contain any information related to the organization's resilience to climate-related scenarios, including a 2°C target or lower scenario. It focuses on the company's social responsibility initiatives, such as the Local Schools Program and support for essential workers during the COVID-19 pandemic. There is no mention of the organization's operational and financial exposure to climate risks, its strategies to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, investment in climate resilience, scenario planning exercises for climate impacts, engagement with stakeholders on climate issues, plans to adapt to physical climate risks, or initiatives aimed at enhancing ecosystem resilience. Therefore, it does not help in answering the question about the organization's resilience to climate change.

It highlights the organization's commitment to employee feedback and continuous improvement in the workplace. However, it does not provide any information related to the organization's strategy in addressing climate-related scenarios, including a 2°C target or lower scenario, or its resilience to climate physical risks.

For this reason, particular importance is placed on reducing energy consumption at this site. A significant achievement during FY2022 was the installation of solar panels at the Suzhou plant. Operational since May 2022, the panels generated over 200 kWh of electricity during the fiscal year, representing approximately 4% of total K&S Suzhou energy use during the period the panels were active. In addition to installation of the solar panels, the K&S Suzhou plant has also implemented an Intelligent Energy Management System that enables live monitoring of energy use across various appliances, for example air conditioners and refrigeration equipment.

[Reason]: The paragraph provides information on the organization's efforts to reduce its carbon footprint and improve energy efficiency, specifically mentioning the installation of solar panels at the Suzhou plant and the implementation of an Intelligent Energy Management System. These actions are relevant to the organization's resilience against climate change as they contribute to the organization's ability to manage and mitigate physical climate risks, such as extreme weather events and energy shortages. However, the paragraph does not explicitly mention the organization's strategy in the context of different climate-related scenarios, including a 2°C target or lower scenario, or how its strategy is designed to be resilient under these conditions. It also does not cover the organization's engagement with stakeholders on climate resilience and sustainability issues, nor does it detail any scenario planning exercises or risk assessments conducted by the organization to evaluate the impact of various climate-related scenarios on its operations. Therefore, while the paragraph is somewhat helpful in understanding the organization's efforts towards climate resilience, it does not fully answer the question as it lacks information on the organization's broader strategy and its resilience under different climate scenarios.

[Reason]: The paragraph provides information on the organization's internal structure and processes for managing sustainability issues, including the role of the Corporate Sustainability Department in setting strategic guidelines and coordinating initiatives. It mentions the department's focus on product portfolio and supply chain improvement initiatives and the decarbonization program, which are directly related to the organization's resilience to climate change. However, the paragraph does not provide specific details on how the organization's strategy is resilient under different climate-related scenarios, including a 2°C target or lower scenario, or how it plans to manage and mitigate physical climate risks. It does not mention scenario planning exercises, risk assessments, or specific plans to adapt to physical climate risks, which are critical to understanding the organization's resilience in the face of climate change. Therefore, while the paragraph indicates an organization that is aware of and actively working on sustainability issues, it does not directly answer the question regarding the organization's resilience to different climate scenarios and physical risks.

[Reason]: The paragraph provides information on the organization's efforts in integrating environmental management practices into its operations, including energy efficiency, water conservation, and waste management. It mentions the organization's approach to incorporating climate change risk into its existing enterprise risk management function and board and committee reporting. These actions suggest a level of preparedness and resilience in the organization's strategy to manage and mitigate climate-related risks. However, the paragraph does not explicitly detail the organization's resilience under different climate scenarios, such as a 2°C target or lower scenario, or how it plans to manage physical climate risks like extreme weather events or sea-level rise. It does not provide a comprehensive analysis of the organization's operational and financial exposure to climate-related risks and opportunities under different global warming scenarios. Therefore, while the paragraph indicates some level of resilience in the organization's strategy, it does not fully answer the question as it lacks specific details on the organization's resilience under different climate scenarios and the management of physical climate risks.

It does not mention any strategies, investments, or plans related to climate resilience, adaptation to climate change, or the organization's preparedness for different climate scenarios. Therefore, it does not contain information that would help answer the question about the resilience of the organization's strategy when considering climate-related scenarios or physical risks.

<paragraph>: ""Reuse of products and packaging materials (GRI 301-3) Due to their long service life and the way in which they are installed, Geberit products can only be reused or recycled to a very limited extent. A targeted improvement in recyclability can be achieved by using recyclable thermoplastics instead of nonrecyclable duroplast plastics, as is the case with the manufacture of a WC seat and lid at the plant in Pfullendorf (DE). In the case of packaging materials, Geberit's goal-also as part of eco-design workshops-is to keep amounts as low as possible, to continuously increase the share of recycled material, and to simplify the recycling and return processes. Efforts to reduce packaging amounts are already starting to bear fruit. For example, certain packaging levels are being omitted, bags reduced in size or thinner foils used, while instructions are printed directly on the packaging rather than on paper, or replaced by a QR code. In addition, care is being taken to avoid the use of polystyrene (EPS) wherever possible and, where necessary, to replace it with recyclable cardboard. A good example here is the  redesign of the packaging for the sanitary flush unit. Proven standard packaging-introduced as part of an effort to reduce complexity-is now also being reviewed. Since 2021, WC lids are shipped in cardboard boxes that have been reduced in size as far as possible. These boxes are almost four times lighter than those used previously, cause 70% fewer CO$_{2}$ emissions and are both easier to use and cheaper to procure. The packaging of the MasterFix fittings was also revised in the reporting year. The annual material savings amount to 1.8 tonnes of cardboard and 58,000 m$^{2}$of plastic foil-an area equivalent to around eight football fields. This results in a saving of around 24 tonnes of CO$_{2}$ per year.""

[Reason]: The paragraph provides information on the organization's efforts to understand and manage its greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, including the hiring of a third party to quantify its emissions and the implementation of energy efficiency measures. This directly relates to the organization's strategy to reduce its impact on climate change, which is a part of assessing the organization's resilience to climate change. However, the paragraph does not explicitly mention the organization's strategy in the context of different climate-related scenarios, including a 2°C target or lower scenario, or how it plans to manage and mitigate physical climate risks. Therefore, while the paragraph is somewhat relevant to the question as it shows the organization's current actions towards reducing its carbon footprint, it does not provide a comprehensive view of the organization's overall resilience to climate change.

[Reason]: The provided paragraph does not contain any specific information about the processes the organization uses to identify and assess climate-related risks. It mentions the use of the Sustainability Accounting Standards Board (SASB) Index for medical equipment and supplies but does not detail any specific methods, tools, or strategies for recognizing and evaluating climate change impacts on the company's operations, financial performance, or overall sustainability. The information is more of a general introduction to the company's corporate responsibility and does not address the question directly.

<paragraph>: ""Rewilding Bison with Indigenous Partners From the Bronx Zoo to the Great Plains The bison, or buffalo, is an American conservation success story. In the 1800s, tens of millions roamed North America. Those numbers had plummeted to fewer than 1,100 animals when in the early 20th century, WCS sent Bronx Zoo-bred bison out west to re-establish the species in its native habitat. Together with Indigenous nations, we brought bison back from the edge of extinction. Today, WCS uses science-based solutions to conserve this species and supports Indigenous Peoples in maintaining viable populations so that bison can once again fulfill their essential ecological and cultural roles. In 2022, we sent six Bronx Zoo-born genetically pure bison to the Osage Nation's 17,400-hectare ranch in Oklahoma: to augment the genetics of the Osage's existing bison herd, and to help the tribe preserve their cultural heritage and the ecology of their ancestral lands. The return of bison to these lands benefits soil health, carbon storage, and the abundance and diversity of grassland plants, pollinators, amphibians, birds, and mammals, as well as revitalizing cultural and community well-being.""

[Reason]: The paragraph provides information about Toyota's efforts in recycling and resource management as part of their broader environmental action plan. It mentions the construction of a wind power generator and initiatives to increase the reuse rate of precious resources. However, it does not directly address the company's net-zero target or provide details on strategies or actions to reduce greenhouse gas emissions to achieve this goal. The information is more focused on resource recycling and does not cover the specific areas of interest related to net-zero emissions, such as the year by which the company aims to achieve net-zero, efforts to improve energy efficiency, or investments in renewable energy sources.

[Reason]: The paragraph provided focuses on the company's supplier audit and quality control processes. It discusses the company's efforts in ensuring the quality, safety, and integrity of its supply chain by conducting audits and monitoring supplier performance. However, it does not mention any information related to the company's net-zero target or transition plan to achieve it. The information is centered on internal operations and does not address the company's goals for reducing greenhouse gas emissions or the strategies it has in place to reach those goals.

[Reason]: The paragraph provides information about the company's efforts in reducing greenhouse gas emissions and total energy consumption through various initiatives such as the Complexity Reduction Initiative and the relocation of their headquarters to a LEED and ENERGY STAR certified office space. This directly addresses parts of the question related to the company's actions in reducing its carbon footprint and efforts to improve energy efficiency. However, the paragraph does not mention a specific year by which the company aims to achieve net-zero emissions or detail a clear transition plan with specific strategies or actions to be taken to reach this goal. Therefore, while the paragraph is somewhat helpful in showing the company's efforts in reducing its environmental impact, it does not fully answer the question as it lacks information on the net-zero target and a detailed transition plan.

[Reason]: The provided paragraph does not contain any information related to the company's net-zero target or transition plan to reach it. It focuses on the financial aspects of the company, such as the valuation of currency swaps and unlisted shares, and does not mention any environmental or sustainability strategies, including those aimed at reducing greenhouse gas emissions or transitioning to net-zero emissions.

[Reason]: The provided paragraph does not contain any information related to the company's indirect emissions (Scope 3) as defined by the Greenhouse Gas Protocol. It focuses on the company's support for International Mens Health Week, team member health journeys, and the development of training modules for workplace safety and compliance. These activities are not directly related to the company's operations or value chain, which are the areas of interest for Scope 3 emissions reporting. Therefore, the paragraph does not contribute to answering the question about the scope 3 emissions of the company.

In March 2022, three robots from our supplier in Israel were dismantled and recycled at the Ecology for a Protected Community plant, an ecological enterprise specializing in recycling electronic waste. Robots are a form of electronic waste, and improper disposal can lead to the leaching of toxic substances such as lead and mercury into our groundwater and soil. In addition to preventing environmental degradation, K&S hopes to strengthen the employment of people with disabilities. This ecological enterprise employs workers with disabilities, and it was an opportunity to contribute towards reducing stigmatization and ensuring a fair and inclusive workplace for all.""

[Reason]: The paragraph provided does not contain any information related to the company's indirect emissions, which are categorized under Scope 3 by the Greenhouse Gas Protocol. Instead, it focuses on the company's community engagement and environmental efforts, such as volunteering to support a food bank, recycling efforts, and employment of people with disabilities. These activities do not directly or indirectly contribute to the company's Scope 3 emissions, which are associated with activities that the company does not own or control and are not directly related to the company's operations or value chain.

One of GXO's innovative solutions was a method of washing produce trays that uses cold water instead of hot. A change in the cleaning chemical and washing equipment allowed us to maintain the same level of quality and hygiene, all with cold water. Outcomes By reducing energy that would have been used to heat the water, we were able to deliver financial and environmental savings to the customer. Since 2009, the customer has sent zero waste directly to a landfill. Each week, GXO handles an average of 5,375 metric tons of cardboard and 410 metric tons of plastic waste and washes 4.4 million trays.

Instead, it focuses on the company's efforts in waste management and innovative solutions for cleaning produce trays with cold water, aiming to reduce energy consumption and achieve environmental savings. These activities do not directly address the question regarding the scope of emissions that are not produced by the company itself but are associated with its activities from sources that it does not own or control.

Spotlight: Consolidating the supplier network for an industrial customer The opportunity A major aerospace customer asked GXO to help improve efficiency in its supply chain, which was creating outsized costs and excessive delays. At the time, its supply chain comprised over 10,000 individual components from manufacturers across the U.S., and there were 36,000 shipments annually across the supply chain. The solution GXO's solution was to aggregate the demand from the customer and up to 300 of its Tier 1 suppliers for critical components, create a single forecast per part number back to the manufacturer and distribute the component supply effectively. Additionally, GXO opened a distribution center that is within 50 miles of 90% of the customer's Tier 1 suppliers.""

The results were then reviewed and amended slightly by an external stakeholder panel. As part of the integration of the ceramics business, a comprehensive review was carried out in 2015. There were no major changes in the material topics. A further review and update of the material topics was carried out in 2018 as part of the switchover to the GRI Standards. In agreement with the Group Executive Board, the update of the materiality analysis in the reporting year focused on aligning it closely with the corporate strategy and sustainability strategy. The previously required listing of many individual GRI aspects was dispensed with. This resulted in fewer topics overall.

[Reason]: The paragraph provided does not offer specific information on targets related to understanding, quantifying, and benchmarking climate-related risks and opportunities within the organization. It focuses on a particular initiative (Café Cascabel) aimed at promoting entrepreneurship in coffee production and mentions the organization's environmental procedures and guidelines, including the review of these procedures and engagement with the community on environmental monitoring. However, it lacks details on specific carbon emission reduction targets, renewable energy usage goals, water usage reduction targets, initiatives for enhancing biodiversity, financial investments in climate resilience, low-carbon product development, employee engagement on sustainability, collaboration with external stakeholders on climate issues, or the use of climate scenario analysis to inform strategy. Therefore, it does not directly answer the question regarding the organization's climate-related targets and their performance against these goals.

[Reason]: The paragraph provides information on the development of a fluxless Thermo-Compression Bonding (TCB) process, which is an environmentally friendly innovation that reduces water and energy consumption, as well as waste production. It also mentions the organization's efforts in collaborating with customers to understand and incorporate environmental efficiency into the product development process. However, the paragraph does not specify any targets or metrics related to climate-related risks and opportunities, such as carbon emission reduction goals, renewable energy usage targets, water usage reduction targets, or any other specific initiatives aimed at mitigating climate change impact. Therefore, while the paragraph highlights the organization's efforts in environmental sustainability, it does not directly answer the question regarding specific targets and performance against those targets.

[Reason]: The paragraph provides information on the organization's efforts towards understanding and reporting on climate-related risks, including their intention to integrate recommendations from the Taskforce on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD) in the FY2023 Sustainability Report. This indicates a commitment to addressing climate-related issues and suggests an approach to understanding and quantifying these risks through financial reporting. However, the paragraph does not specify any clear targets or metrics related to carbon emission reduction, renewable energy usage, water usage reduction, biodiversity enhancement, financial investments in climate resilience, low-carbon product development, employee engagement in sustainability, external stakeholder collaboration on climate projects, or climate scenario analysis. Therefore, while the paragraph suggests a general commitment to climate-related issues, it does not provide the specific information on targets and performance against those targets that the question seeks.

This can be done through automated solutions to right-size packaging, such as our Small Order Automated Packing (SOAP) machine. Through the use of this technology, SOAP is able to process up to 700 packages per hour, leading to reductions in resource and energy use. HOME SOAP and similar technologies reduce the use of packing materials and reduce package sizing. This allows shipments to use less space on delivery trucks, leading to reduced road miles traveled. Packaging sized to fit can also reduce the likelihood of products becoming damaged during shipping and can require less plastic to fill empty spaces in cartons. In addition to reducing product packaging materials, we also reduce the materials required for shipment packaging.""

[Reason]: The paragraph provided focuses on the organization's efforts in reducing environmental impacts through packaging optimization and shipment reduction strategies. It details the use of technology to right-size packaging and the benefits of this approach, such as resource and energy savings, and a reduction in the need for additional packaging materials. However, it does not mention any specific targets or metrics related to climate-related risks and opportunities that the organization uses to understand, quantify, and benchmark its performance. The information is more about the operational changes and their environmental benefits but lacks the element of specific goals or targets and the organization's progress against them.

In addition to improving performance and delivering gross savings, these activities have allowed us to optimize our geographic footprint and modernize certain manufacturing operations in ways that have helped to meaningfully reduce our Scope 1 and 2 greenhouse gas ('GHG') emissions and total energy consumption. In fiscal 2018, we launched a strategic Complexity Reduction Initiative designed to improve operational performance and reduce costs. As part of this initiative, we relocated our global headquarters in fiscal 2020 from a 224,000 square foot campus in Braintree, Massachusetts to a 62,000 square foot LEED and ENERGY STAR certified office space in Boston, Massachusetts. We also took proactive measures during this program to rationalize our global real estate portfolio and consolidate certain locations outside of the U.S.""

[Reason]: The paragraph provides information on the organization's efforts to reduce its environmental impact, such as restructuring activities to capture efficiencies and enhance commercial capabilities, and the relocation of its headquarters to a LEED and ENERGY STAR certified office space. These actions indicate a strategic approach to reducing greenhouse gas emissions and total energy consumption, which are directly related to understanding, quantifying, and benchmarking climate-related risks and opportunities. However, the paragraph does not specify any clear targets or metrics that the organization is using to measure its progress in these areas. It only mentions the outcomes of certain actions taken, such as the reduction in emissions and energy consumption. Therefore, while the paragraph is somewhat relevant as it shows the organization's efforts in reducing its environmental impact, it does not provide the specific information on targets or benchmarks that the question seeks.

It focuses on the process of performance management, including goal setting and the assessment of senior leaders and potential successors. There is no mention of carbon emission reduction targets, renewable energy usage goals, water usage reduction targets, initiatives for enhancing biodiversity, financial investments in climate resilience, or any other specific climate-related targets that the organization might have set.

Our management team is responsible for managing risk on a day-to-day basis and for bringing to the Board's attention material risks facing the company. The Board focuses on the quality and scope of Haemonetics' risk management strategies and considers the most significant areas of risk inherent in the company's business strategies and operations as well as the steps that management is taking to mitigate those risks. Additionally, Board committees consider discrete categories of risk relating to their respective areas of responsibility. All committees report to the full Board as appropriate, including when a matter rises to the level of a material or enterprise-level risk. Senior management has overall responsibility for Haemonetics' risk management approach. This responsibility includes identifying, evaluating and addressing potential risks that may exist at the enterprise, strategic, financial, operational, compliance and reporting levels. Haemonetics' Global Internal Audit function, which reports regularly to the Audit Committee, serves as the primary monitoring and testing function for compliance with company-wide policies and procedures.

It focuses on the company's overall approach to sustainability through supplier monitoring, engagement, and collaboration in the value chain. It mentions the company's efforts in reporting and disclosure of key ESG issues, its participation in CDP and Walmart's Project Gigaton, and its response to EcoVadis and General Motors' Top Supplier recognition for sustainability and innovation. However, it lacks details on the company's specific carbon reduction methods or the use of verified carbon credits. Therefore, it does not directly answer the question regarding the various carbon strategies and the types of verified carbon credits the company prefers and how much it has used.

Our Human Resources team reviews our compensation practices against the markets where we compete on a regular basis to ensure we are able to attract and retain top talent. COMPENSATION Haemonetics provides market-competitive base pay to compensate individuals for technical competencies required for their position and to help provide economic security. In addition to base salary, most of our employees have variable components to their compensation that are tied to achievement of corporate and individual performance goals, the fluctuations of our stock price, or a combination of both.

[Reason]: The paragraph provided does not offer any information related to the specific tools or instruments used by the organization to manage climate risks. Instead, it focuses on the company's engagement with suppliers, the development of a sustainability program, and the auditing of suppliers on various topics including Environmental, Health, and Safety (EHS), quality, process control, Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG), and Innovation, Design, and Engineering (IDEA). While these activities are related to sustainability and could indirectly support the company's approach to managing climate risks, the paragraph does not explicitly mention any tools or instruments for climate risk management such as climate risk assessment software, an Environmental Management System (EMS), the TCFD framework, or any other specific method or technology for climate risk management as outlined in the background information.

[Reason]: The paragraph provides a general overview of the company's sustainability efforts and achievements, including those related to waste recycling, energy consumption, and community outreach. It mentions the company's participation in the CDP Climate Change 2022 Score, which indicates an awareness of climate change and a commitment to reporting on this issue. However, it does not provide specific information on the tools or instruments used to manage climate risks, such as climate risk assessment software, Environmental Management Systems (EMS), the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD) framework, or any other specific methods, technologies, strategies, or frameworks mentioned in the background information. Therefore, while the paragraph suggests an awareness and some level of action on climate change issues, it does not directly answer the question regarding the specific tools or instruments used for managing climate risks.

Located in the Mirpur area, within the metropolitan city of Dhaka, Sirajgonj has a workforce of almost a thousand people, mostly women, and almost 100% of its production capacity is for OVS, with whom it has been collaborating since 2012. Through the audit processes, some critical issues, mainly related to workers' rights, emerged at an early stage. Despite follow-up and monitoring actions, three years later, the situation had still not improved. 03 Being fair and transparent Thus, in consultation with colleagues from the Group's Sustainability function, different approaches to intervention and involvement of Sirajgonj in a specially designed and created development and improvement program were evaluated.""

[Reason]: The paragraph does not provide any information about the tools or instruments OVS is using to manage climate risks. Instead, it focuses on a specific issue related to a company (Sirajgonj Fashion Ltd.) that OVS is collaborating with, including a description of the company's location, workforce composition, and the history of collaboration between the two companies. The paragraph also mentions the challenges faced in addressing workers' rights issues and the efforts to intervene and improve the situation. However, it does not mention any methods, technologies, strategies, or frameworks that OVS employs to identify, assess, and mitigate climate risks. Therefore, it does not contribute to answering the question about the tools or instruments used for climate risk management.

[Reason]: The paragraph provides information about HARMAN's commitment to carbon neutrality by 2040 and mentions specific goals such as waste to landfill reduction in manufacturing operations and a reduction in electricity consumption. This indicates that HARMAN is employing strategies to manage climate risks, particularly in the areas of operational efficiency and renewable energy procurement. However, the paragraph does not explicitly mention any tools or instruments used to manage these risks, such as climate risk assessment software, an Environmental Management System (EMS), the TCFD framework, or any other specific methods or technologies mentioned in the background information. Therefore, while the paragraph suggests that HARMAN is taking steps to manage climate risks, it does not provide detailed information on the tools or instruments used for this purpose.

It mentions the use of a ""Climate Risk Assessment"" to identify climate-related risks and the implementation of measures to manage these risks through their enterprise risk management program. This directly addresses the first example of information the question is looking for, which is the use of climate risk assessment software to identify and quantify the potential impacts of various climate scenarios on the company's operations. Additionally, the paragraph mentions the implementation of measures to reduce the company's environmental footprint, such as monitoring and mitigating their carbon footprint, eliminating plastic water bottles, and participating in recycling programs. These actions align with several other examples of tools and instruments for managing climate risks, such as the implementation of an Environmental Management System (EMS), investment in renewable energy projects, and development of a climate resilience strategy.
