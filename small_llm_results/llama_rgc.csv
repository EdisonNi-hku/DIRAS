[Reason]: The paragraph provides some information related to the company's strategy to achieve sustainability objectives, specifically mentioning the development of innovative and durable sanitary products, resource efficiency in production and product use, and the focus on innovation and sustainability.

[Reason]: The paragraph appears to be a report on Toyota's environmental action plan, specifically focusing on climate-related financial disclosures based on the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD) recommendations. The text mentions the evaluation of the plan's progress, targets, and expected outcomes, which could potentially provide some information on how Toyota expects its financial performance to change over time.

Reason: The paragraph does not provide any information about the financial performance of the company over time, nor does it discuss the expected financial implications of achieving the sustainability objectives and priorities outlined. The paragraph focuses on the prioritization of material topics, long-term ESG goals, and the categorization of performance metrics, which does not address the financial aspects of the transition plan.

The paragraph does not provide any relevant information to answer the question, which is seeking details on how the company's financial performance is expected to change over time.

Reason: The paragraph appears to be a company's sustainability report, which provides information on their environmental, social, and governance (ESG) efforts.

<question>: ""what are the social contributions or efforts mentioned?""
<paragraph>: ""It is a crescendo of attempts to bring the non-profit world closer to the profit world. Fashion experiments, studies products for disabled people, for example collections for wheelchair users. Others try to combine fragility and sustainability by creating a new strength. The for-profit world has realised that it is no longer enough to recover products, we must also recover people.From zero to half a thousand: what happens when solidarity becomes contagious? It was 2007 when six parents founded the association. Underlying this was the idea that everyone should do their share of the'investment'. Just as families had to put energy and passion into it, communities could engage in fundraising, while public bodies would play the role of facilitators. Businesses would eventually recognise the economic value of what we do. And so it went: in little more than ten years we have become a reference for 130 families, and then for another 200 who find answers for their children. Today we offer opportunities to work to more than 40 people with intellectual disabilities.""

[Reason]: The paragraph is not directly addressing the question of ""what are the social contributions or efforts mentioned?"" as it does not provide specific information about the company's social contributions or efforts. The paragraph appears to be discussing the founding of an association and its growth, but it does not mention any specific social contributions or efforts made by a company.

[Guess]: No

The paragraph does not provide any information about the company's social contributions or efforts, and it seems to be discussing a separate entity, an association, which is not directly related to the question.

<paragraph>: "" Values such as integrity, team spirit, enthusiasm, modesty and an ability to embrace change are core factors. The long-term corporate strategy is based on four pillars: Focus on sanitary products, Commitment to innovation and sustainability, Selective geographic expansion and Continuous optimisation of business processes.

The sustainability strategy supplements the corporate strategy and the growth and earnings drivers with twelve concrete modules.. These modules strengthen the business model and generate added value for various stakeholders in the areas People (employees and society), Planet (environment) and Profit (value chain including compliance and governance) in a targeted manner.

Ensuring we implement strong risk assessment and due diligence processes is therefore critical.With greater visibility we have been able to improve the quality of our supplier data within this category, which in turn supported the more detailed modern slavery risk assessment that we undertook in the latter half of 2021. In the research conducted into the suppliers of our Accent owned brands, the majority of our suppliers in this category were rated inherently high for risks of modern slavery as their sourcing location was based on the country of manufacture, which for the suppliers of Accent owned brands is primarily in China.

<paragraph>: ""DAN: Climate change fundamentally threatens our core mission to save wildlife and wild places; we've all seen the harm done by worsening droughts and wildfires. But WCS also brings distinctive strengths to solving this crisis. Forests remain our greatest climate asset; globally, they remove a third of the CO$_{2}$ emitted each year from burning fossil fuels. And most of that removal is done by the kind of high-integrity forests and peatlands WCS field programs help protect.With our on-the-ground presence in more than 50 countries-including thousands of staff working closely with governments and communities-WCS can be a significant piece of the global climate solution. The key is to bring financial investment into conservation in a whole new way. Intact forests keep the planet as much as a degree cooler than it would be without their help. If we value that natural climate control-which is worth tens of trillions of dollars to the global economy-we can create sustainable protections for these vital ecosystems, the wildlife they shelter, and the climate itself.""

<paragraph>: ""Q: How did you come to this work?DAN: I've focused on the intersection between forests and climate for more than 30 years, as a professor and then working in philanthropy. I came to WCS because I think, right now, it's where I can have the greatest impact-building on the unrivaled work of our field conservation programs and connecting those assets to global policy and financesolutions. It's clear that we are in no way separate from nature. Whether in the most remote regions or in the heart of a city, we are all linked to one another and to our animal relatives. We are mutually dependent. Africa's forest elephants, for instance, are like gardeners: they weed out smaller brush, which allows big trees to get bigger, locking away carbon. A single elephant contributes to many additional tons of CO$_{2}$ storage, helping regulate our climate. As an ecosystem ecologist, I think of species as parts of a larger system, and that's true of humans as well.""

[Reason]: The paragraph provides some information about Geberit's governance structure and its approach to sustainability, which is relevant to the question about the organization's strategy and resilience in the face of climate-related scenarios. Specifically, it mentions the Board of Directors' responsibility for climate-related risks and opportunities, which is a crucial aspect of the organization's preparedness. Additionally, the paragraph highlights the importance of sustainability strategy, which includes modules related to climate change mitigation.

However, the paragraph does not directly address the specific aspects of the question, such as the organization's preparedness for a 2°C target or lower scenario, physical climate risks, or scenario planning exercises. The paragraph focuses more on the governance structure and general sustainability approach rather than providing concrete information about the organization's resilience to specific climate-related scenarios.

[Guess]: No

I am not very confident in my guess because the paragraph does not provide the specific information requested in the question.

<paragraph>: ""It is well known that we need to drastically reduce our dependence on fossil fuels in order to achieve the goal of limiting global warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius. But there is less awareness that we have natural solutions to the climate crisis available right now. For example, the earth's forests sponge up 30 percent of the carbon dioxide we release into the atmosphere each year-and they will keep doing this work for us if we make sure they are not cut down.In this section, you can read about how WCS is leading global efforts to advance nature-positive solutions to the climate crisis-from protecting the forests of the Congo Basin, the largest tropical net carbon sink on Earth, to conserving the peatlands of boreal Canada, which store even more carbon than intact forests. And since some of the effects of climate change are unavoidable, WCS is also working to help wildlife, ecosystems, and communities adapt to changing conditions.""

[Reason]: The paragraph is partially helpful for answering the question. It provides some information about the organization's understanding of the risks posed by climate change, its willingness to adapt to these risks, and its plans to mitigate them. Specifically, it mentions the identification of significant risks related to climate change, the implementation of measures to promote electrification and renewable energy, and the support for the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD). However, the paragraph does not provide a comprehensive assessment of the organization's strategy's resilience under different climate-related scenarios, including a 2°C target or lower scenario, nor does it provide specific details on the organization's preparedness for physical climate risks.

[Guess]: No
[Confidence]: 0.8

I am not very confident in my guess because the paragraph does not provide the level of detail and specificity required to fully answer the question.

<paragraph>: ""Q: How did you come to this work?DAN: I've focused on the intersection between forests and climate for more than 30 years, as a professor and then working in philanthropy. I came to WCS because I think, right now, it's where I can have the greatest impact-building on the unrivaled work of our field conservation programs and connecting those assets to global policy and financesolutions. It's clear that we are in no way separate from nature. Whether in the most remote regions or in the heart of a city, we are all linked to one another and to our animal relatives. We are mutually dependent. Africa's forest elephants, for instance, are like gardeners: they weed out smaller brush, which allows big trees to get bigger, locking away carbon. A single elephant contributes to many additional tons of CO$_{2}$ storage, helping regulate our climate. As an ecosystem ecologist, I think of species as parts of a larger system, and that's true of humans as well.""

<paragraph>: ""Important sustainability issuesThe Nordic countries still have a long way to go to achieve carbon neutrality despite targets and plans for net zero emissions of greenhouse gases. The construction and real estate industries have a vital part to play in climate transition and are thereforedriving various initiatives to reduce carbon emissions in line with the Paris Agreement, particularly through the Road map for fossil free competitiveness that Peab has also signed onto. The construction and civil engineering industry, together with seven other trade organizations, work within the road map to achieve a climate neutral construction sector. This work comprises the entire value chain from planning and implementation to demolition and reuse.Creating sustainable cities includes energy efficient buildings and a construction process that uses material and processes in a climate-adapted manner. Looking at it from a broader perspective, cities' sustainability relies on energy-smart community planning with, for example, circular flows that lower climate impact.""

<Reason>: The paragraph provides some information about SolGold's decarbonization strategy and its efforts to measure and report greenhouse gas emissions. It mentions the company's participation in the Zero Carbon Ecuador Program and its three-stage strategy to reduce carbon emissions. However, the paragraph does not directly address the question of what processes SolGold uses to identify and assess climate-related risks.

The paragraph is not directly relevant to the question because it focuses on the company's strategy to reduce emissions, which is a different aspect of climate risk management.

<paragraph>: ""DAN: Climate change fundamentally threatens our core mission to save wildlife and wild places; we've all seen the harm done by worsening droughts and wildfires. But WCS also brings distinctive strengths to solving this crisis. Forests remain our greatest climate asset; globally, they remove a third of the CO$_{2}$ emitted each year from burning fossil fuels. And most of that removal is done by the kind of high-integrity forests and peatlands WCS field programs help protect.With our on-the-ground presence in more than 50 countries-including thousands of staff working closely with governments and communities-WCS can be a significant piece of the global climate solution. The key is to bring financial investment into conservation in a whole new way. Intact forests keep the planet as much as a degree cooler than it would be without their help. If we value that natural climate control-which is worth tens of trillions of dollars to the global economy-we can create sustainable protections for these vital ecosystems, the wildlife they shelter, and the climate itself.""

Members of our manufacturing teams in our factories globally have been instrumental in reducing our impact. We have successfully completed multiple energy efficiency projects in 2021, including lighting system improvements and air compressor and HVAC chiller upgrades. We are in the process of implementing additional improvements, including the installation of sub-metering systems at our facility in Hungary, which will allow for better monitoring and control of energy consumption.We are also focusing on renewable electricity to reduce our operational emissions. In 2021, our first on-site solar installation came online in Pune, India. The installation is anticipated to produce around 163,200 kWh annually. In addition to the environmental benefit of renewable electricity, the Pune installation affords our site with increased energy independence, bolstering resiliency in a climate-uncertain future. By 2025, HARMAN has committed to sourcing 100% renewable electricity across our entire global manufacturing footprint, aligned with our RE100 targets.""

Additionally, it mentions that they will be collecting data on Scope 3 emissions in FY2023. However, the paragraph does not explicitly state a specific target for achieving net-zero emissions or provide a detailed transition plan to reach it.

[Guess]: No

The paragraph does not provide a clear answer to the question of whether the company has a clearly stated net-zero target and a transition plan to reach it. While it mentions some initiatives and plans, it does not provide the specific information requested in the question.

<paragraph>: ""The Geberit Group stands for an ambitious and implementation-oriented approach in its activities. This also applies to the new CO$_{2}$ strategy developed in 2021 and implemented in the reporting year.. The goal in the future is to continue to reduce CO$_{2}$ intensity by an average of 5% per year. As such, Geberit is looking to achieve a long-term reduction in absolute CO$_{2}$ emissions from 183,886 tonnes in 2021 to 121,000 tonnes by 2035. In comparison with the reference year 2015, relative CO$_{2}$ emissions are to be reduced by 70% by 2030 and by 80% by 2035, while absolute CO$_{2}$ emissions are to fall by 47% and 50% by 2030 and 2035 respectively. The targeted reduction in emissions (Scopes 1 and 2) is equivalent to a contribution to a reduction path that limits CO$_{2}$ emissions to 'well below 2°C' above pre-industrial levels.A central element of the new CO$_{2}$ strategy is its integration in all relevant and existing business processes as well as the handling of CO$_{2}$ emissions as external costs by means of internal CO$_{2}$ pricing.""

[Reason]: The paragraph provides some information about the company's reduction targets and its alignment with the Science Based Targets initiative, which is a good starting point for answering the question. However, it does not provide a clear statement of a net-zero target or a detailed transition plan to achieve it. The paragraph mainly focuses on the company's reduction targets and its progress towards achieving them, but it does not provide information on the specific actions or strategies the company plans to implement to reach net-zero emissions.

[Guess]: No

[Reason]: The paragraph appears to be a table showing the progress of the company's KPIs related to greenhouse gas emissions, specifically Scope 1, Scope 2, and Scope 3 emissions. The table provides data on the actual performance of the company in 2022 compared to the baseline, as well as the target for the current year. However, it does not explicitly state a clear net-zero target or a transition plan to achieve it.

The paragraph does not provide information on the company's plans to reduce its carbon footprint, invest in renewable energy, improve energy efficiency, or offset remaining emissions, which are essential components of a transition plan to achieve net-zero emissions. The paragraph only focuses on the company's performance in reducing its greenhouse gas emissions, but does not provide a clear roadmap or strategy to achieve net-zero emissions.

[Guess]: No

I am fairly confident that the paragraph is not helpful in answering the question, as it does not provide the necessary information on the company's net-zero target and transition plan.

[Reason]: The paragraph provides some information related to the company's environmental goals, including a target to reduce GHG emissions (Scopes 1 & 2) by 30% by 2030 and to become 100% carbon neutral by 2040. However, it does not explicitly state a net-zero target and a transition plan to achieve it. The paragraph also does not provide a clear roadmap or set of actions to reduce direct and indirect greenhouse gas emissions associated with the company's operations and supply chain.

[Guess]: No
[Confidence]: 0.8

The paragraph does not provide a clear answer to the question, as it does not specify a net-zero target and a transition plan to achieve it. While it mentions some environmental goals, it does not provide the specific information required to answer the question.<|eot_id|>"

[Reason]: The paragraph provides some information about the company's scope 3 emissions, specifically stating that they were 1,503,000 metric tons CO2e in 2022. This is a direct answer to the question of what scope 3 says. However, the paragraph does not provide information about the scope 3 emissions from sources that the company does not own or control, such as the production of purchased materials, transportation of purchased fuels, and use of sold products and services, which are the types of emissions the question is asking about.

[Guess]: No

The paragraph only provides information about the company's own scope 3 emissions, which is a small part of the overall scope 3 emissions that the question is asking about. The paragraph does not provide information about the emissions from activities such as the production of purchased materials, transportation of purchased fuels, and use of sold products and services, which are the types of emissions the question is looking for.

[Reason]: The paragraph appears to be a section from a report that provides information on the organizational boundaries and scope of greenhouse gas emissions reporting for Toyota Motor Corporation and its consolidated subsidiaries. It mentions the calculation of Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions, as well as Scope 3 emissions, which are indirect emissions from sources not owned or controlled by the company. The paragraph also mentions third-party verification and provides specific data for 2021.

[Guess]: No
[Confidence]: 0.8

I believe the paragraph is not directly helpful in answering the question ""what the scope 3 says?"" because it does not provide a clear explanation or definition of Scope 3 emissions, nor does it provide specific information on the types of indirect emissions that are included in this category. The paragraph appears to be more focused on providing an overview of the company's emissions reporting scope and boundaries, rather than providing detailed information on the specific emissions that fall under Scope 3.<|eot_id|>"

The paragraph does not provide any relevant information about Scope 3 emissions, which are indirect emissions associated with the company's activities, such as the production of purchased materials, transportation of purchased fuels, and use of sold products and services.

<paragraph>: ""As a community builder Peab has broad and diversified operations. We are active in four Nordic countries with an extensive geographic presence as well as customers in both the private and public sectors. Our four business areas Construction, Civil Engineering, Industry and Project Development are independent but ensure through collaboration that we utilize local resources as far as possible in the form of our own personnel and input goods. In other words, Peab's business comprises many different kinds of activities that come under the EU taxonomy. At the same time Peab's operations are characterized by further conditions that provide the framework for how our reporting according to the EU taxonomy should be understood. Our operations are primarily carried out as projects where every project is unique, which makes evaluating each project demanding. In our construction and civil engineering operations customers by and large formulate the specifications of the project. This reduces Peab's ability to influence the outcome, even if we work actively with holding dialogues with customers early on. In addition, lead times are long in the industry-from zoning to completed project-and therefore it takes years before new requirements are realized in operations and reporting.""

<paragraph>: ""The criteria for DNSH have been evaluated and Peab's ECO-products are considered to meet them.· Climate change adaptation: Considered met because we have performed climate risk and vulnerability analyses for all the manufacturing units of ECO-products and identified possible risk redu cing measures.· The sustainable use and protection of water and marine resources: Considered met because of compliance with valid laws since water activities and other situations that affect environment quality norms for water always require an Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) and taking relevant safeguards.· The transition to a circular economy: Considered met because Peab applies the industry's guidelines for waste management that steer towards sorting for possible material recycling. Peab also regularly evaluates the possibility of circular material flows concerning both input raw material for production and the recyclability of manufactured products. Examples of this are the binder Merit, based on slag which is a byproduct from the steel industry, our ECO-Ballast (ECO-Mineral aggregates) which is based on 100 percent reused raw material and is used in concrete and asphalt as well as reclaimed asphalt pavement as raw material in our paving production. There are EPDs for all our ECO-products.""

<question>: ""what the scope 3 says?""
<paragraph>: ""A wide range of measures for saving energy and increasing efficiency are planned at the plants. Accordingly, the area of ceramics, which accounts for around two-thirds of all Geberit's CO$_{2}$ emissions, has the largest structural savings potential. This includes a special focus on the reduction of scrap rates. The firing process and the use of the resulting waste heat will be further optimised. This can be used for other process steps, such as drying the cast plaster moulds or ceramic blanks. Furthermore, projects were launched to investigate the possibilities of switching to renewable energy sources-for example, ecologically produced hydrogen-in the long term as well as the systematic reuse of ceramic waste.Fuel consumption is determined primarily by the company's own and leased fleet of cars and delivery vans. Since early 2008, binding guidelines have also applied for the purchase of new vehicles. As of 2019, these guidelines were adjusted to take into account the new Worldwide Harmonised Light Vehicles Test Procedure (WLTP).""

<paragraph>: ""In general, all of the topics included in the materiality analysis and the associated goals and measures are constantly promoted, see  Sustainability strategy. The  Panel Statement confirms Geberit's perception-often expressed both internally and externally-that Geberit products are crucial for the added value of the company. Additionally, customers and other stakeholders are increasingly focusing on environmental and sustainability performance. The efficient handling of water remains one of the most important topics at Geberit. Saving water is directly linked to reducing energy consumption, which in turn indirectly reduces CO$_{2}$ emissions in the product use phase. The company has emphasised this link for years with reference to the  water footprint. Accordingly, Geberit's most significant contribution to climate change mitigation is then through water-saving solutions. An example of this is the new Acanto WC system solution with TurboFlush technology, which also features an extremely quiet flush and requires minimal cleaning.""

<background_information>: ""Meaning of the question: The question ""what the scope 3 says?"" is asking for information about the indirect emissions that are not produced by the company itself but are associated with its activities, from sources that they do not own or control. This is a part of greenhouse gas emissions reporting, categorized under Scope 3 by the Greenhouse Gas Protocol. It encompasses emissions from activities such as the production of purchased materials, transportation of purchased fuels, and use of sold products and services.

Examples of information that the question is looking for:
1. Emissions resulting from the transportation of raw materials to the company by third-party vehicles.
2. Emissions from the manufacturing of products by suppliers that are part of the company's value chain.
3. Emissions associated with employee business travel and commuting in vehicles not owned by the company.
4. Waste generated in operations and its disposal by third-party services.
5. Emissions from the use of the company’s sold products and services, such as the energy consumption of electronic devices manufactured by the company.

7. Investments in projects or activities outside of the company's direct operations that indirectly contribute to greenhouse gas emissions, such as financial investments in companies with significant emissions profiles.""
<question>: ""what the scope 3 says?""
<paragraph>: ""Overall Scope 3 emissions were reduced by 6% compared to the previous year. OVS has defined Scope 3 emissionreduction targets on categories that are particularly relevant and where there is significant scope for action.As can be seen from the following table, thanks to an improved raw materials portfolio with a greater selection of low-impact materials and the reduction in the incidence of shipments by air, Scope 3 emissions decreased by 11% compared to 2019, substantially in line with the target of 12.6% defined by the objectives approved by SBTi. Considering the reduction per kg of product, the reduction is 12%.The significant reduction in transport emissions comes from the almost complete elimination of air transport. The slight upward shift from 2021 in emissions related to purchased Goods and Services should be read in light of the fact that in 2022, some purchases of finished goods were brought forward compared to the normal procurement curve typically adopted.""

We are pleased to report on the results of our GHG assessment, which includes a 19% reduction in Scope 1 and 2 GHG emissions and a reduction of 7,813 MWh of energy in fiscal 2022 compared to our fiscal 2018 baseline. In calendar 2023, we plan to take the next steps in defining our long-range goals to further reduce our Scope 1 and 2 carbon emissions and assess our Scope 3 emissions.""

Reason: The paragraph does not provide information on the categories of Scope 3 emissions reported by the company, which is a crucial aspect of the question. It only discusses the company's efforts in assessing and reducing Scope 1 and 2 emissions, but does not provide any information on Scope 3 emissions.

Guess: No

Confidence: 0.9

The paragraph does not address the specific question of what categories of Scope 3 emissions the company reports, which is a key aspect of the question. While it mentions the company's plans to assess Scope 3 emissions in the future, it does not provide any concrete information on the categories of Scope 3 emissions reported in the current reporting period.

[Reason]: The paragraph appears to be a collection of various sustainability-related initiatives and reports from a company, including environmental data, climate-related financial disclosures, and risk management strategies. While it mentions ""Environmental Data"" and ""Climate-related Financial Disclosures"", it does not specifically address the categories of Scope 3 emissions or the percentage of total emissions for the reporting period.

[Guess]: No

The paragraph does not provide any information that directly answers the question about the categories of Scope 3 emissions or the percentage of total emissions for the reporting period. It seems to be focused on general sustainability initiatives and reports, rather than providing specific data on Scope 3 emissions.

<paragraph>: ""It is well known that we need to drastically reduce our dependence on fossil fuels in order to achieve the goal of limiting global warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius. But there is less awareness that we have natural solutions to the climate crisis available right now. For example, the earth's forests sponge up 30 percent of the carbon dioxide we release into the atmosphere each year-and they will keep doing this work for us if we make sure they are not cut down.In this section, you can read about how WCS is leading global efforts to advance nature-positive solutions to the climate crisis-from protecting the forests of the Congo Basin, the largest tropical net carbon sink on Earth, to conserving the peatlands of boreal Canada, which store even more carbon than intact forests. And since some of the effects of climate change are unavoidable, WCS is also working to help wildlife, ecosystems, and communities adapt to changing conditions.""

Once a year, the Group Executive Board suggests a CO$_{2}$ reference price as part of the budget, which is then approved by the Board of Directors-this was EUR 60 per tonne of CO$_{2}$ for 2022. This is based on the price of the European Emissions Trading System (ETS) for CO$_{2}$. The internal CO$_{2}$ reference price embodies the reference costs for saving one tonne of CO$_{2}$..

[Reason]: The paragraph is not directly helpful in answering the question because it does not provide specific targets or metrics related to climate-related risks and opportunities. The paragraph discusses the organization's ESG goals, which are not directly related to climate change. The goals mentioned, such as becoming carbon neutral by 2030, are relevant to climate change, but the paragraph does not provide any specific targets or metrics to quantify and benchmark climate-related risks and opportunities.

[Guess]: No
[Confidence]: 0.9

The paragraph does not provide the specific information sought in the question, which is about targets and metrics to understand, quantify, and benchmark climate-related risks and opportunities.

GXO U.K. is the most advanced in our portfolio in its environmental impact reduction and therefore is able to raise its ambition to be net zero (that is, no net carbon emissions across all 3 Scopes) by 2045. We are proud of its example and further motivated in our work toward reducing our global emissions. Read our UK Carbon Reduction PlanWe are making meaningful and incremental progress on both transparency and impact through expanding our external assurance practices. Our 2022 emissions data for both the U.K and Europe, and Americas and Asia Pacific regions were externally assured.""

We also began implementing energy efficiency measures at our Wyoming operations, starting with transitioning the entire lighting system to LED.It is important to note that, like much of the uranium industry, we operated at a reduced pace to capture residual uranium only during the period the assessment was done.

<paragraph>: ""DAN: Climate change fundamentally threatens our core mission to save wildlife and wild places; we've all seen the harm done by worsening droughts and wildfires. But WCS also brings distinctive strengths to solving this crisis. Forests remain our greatest climate asset; globally, they remove a third of the CO$_{2}$ emitted each year from burning fossil fuels. And most of that removal is done by the kind of high-integrity forests and peatlands WCS field programs help protect.With our on-the-ground presence in more than 50 countries-including thousands of staff working closely with governments and communities-WCS can be a significant piece of the global climate solution. The key is to bring financial investment into conservation in a whole new way. Intact forests keep the planet as much as a degree cooler than it would be without their help. If we value that natural climate control-which is worth tens of trillions of dollars to the global economy-we can create sustainable protections for these vital ecosystems, the wildlife they shelter, and the climate itself.""

[Reason]: The paragraph is not directly helpful in answering the question about the various carbon strategies, such as biofuel, carbon credits, and carbon removals. The paragraph appears to be discussing the company's supplier engagement and sustainability goals, which is a related but distinct topic.

[Guess]: No

The paragraph does not provide any information about the company's use of biofuels, carbon credits, or carbon removals, which are the specific carbon strategies mentioned in the question. While it does mention a goal to reach carbon neutrality by 2030, it does not provide any details on how the company plans to achieve this goal or what specific strategies it will use. The paragraph is more focused on the company's supplier engagement and sustainability goals, which is a broader topic that does not directly address the question.<|eot_id|>"

[Reason]: The paragraph is not directly helpful in answering the question. The paragraph discusses the company's governance structure and sustainability plan, which does not provide information on the company's carbon strategies, such as biofuels, carbon credits, and carbon removals. The paragraph does not address the specific examples of information sought, such as the types of biofuels used, carbon credit verification standards, or the volume of credits purchased.

[Guess]: No

As such, we recognize the importance of conducting business in an environmentally responsible manner and integrating environmental management practices in our operations.We do not expect FNF's core products of title insurance, mortgage real estate services, and real estate technology to be directly impacted by climate change. Title policies do not cover damage to structures or land, including damage due to climate events. Although most of FNF's sources of revenue are not inherently impacted by climate change, areas within our operational, financial, strategic, and compliance processes are exposed to climate-related risks.Climate Risk Assessment and Key Policy Development""

<question>: ""what tools or instrument are beeing used to manage climate risks?""
<paragraph>: ""It is well known that we need to drastically reduce our dependence on fossil fuels in order to achieve the goal of limiting global warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius. But there is less awareness that we have natural solutions to the climate crisis available right now. For example, the earth's forests sponge up 30 percent of the carbon dioxide we release into the atmosphere each year-and they will keep doing this work for us if we make sure they are not cut down.In this section, you can read about how WCS is leading global efforts to advance nature-positive solutions to the climate crisis-from protecting the forests of the Congo Basin, the largest tropical net carbon sink on Earth, to conserving the peatlands of boreal Canada, which store even more carbon than intact forests. And since some of the effects of climate change are unavoidable, WCS is also working to help wildlife, ecosystems, and communities adapt to changing conditions.""

[Reason]: The paragraph provides information about Toyota's risk management system, specifically the TGRS, which covers all risks, including climate change. It explains the process of risk assessment, including the two perspectives of ""magnitude of impact"" and ""vulnerabilities"", and the four-point scale used to assess the level of seriousness of risks. This information is relevant to the question of what tools or instruments are being used to manage climate risks, as it describes a specific framework and process used by Toyota to identify, assess, and mitigate climate-related risks.

The paragraph mentions various standards, such as Sustainability Accounting Standards Board (SASB) and Global Reporting Initiative (GRI), which are relevant to the question of what tools or instruments are being used to manage climate risks. However, the paragraph does not directly address the question of what specific tools or instruments are being used to manage climate risks.

[Guess]: No
[Confidence]: 0.8

I am not confident that the paragraph is directly helpful in answering the question because it does not provide specific information on the tools or instruments used to manage climate risks. The paragraph appears to be a report on the company's sustainability performance, which may be relevant to the question, but it does not provide the specific information requested.<|eot_id|>"

What were the difficulties and challenges you had to overcome along the way? Paolo Lezza : All advanced technologies have a cost: the question is how to achieve the right efficiency to reduce it and remain competitive in the market. In this regard, the search for talent and human resources capable of handling these new technologies, which are also based on artificial intelligence, remains a key issue: in the case of the latest generation of machines, it is not so straightforward to find the right recipe, the appropriate mix of substances to be inserted or sprayed.

<paragraph>: ""We could have done better, but purchases of organic cotton have decreased due to less availability on the market. To fulfil our commitment, we have thus increased the recycled portion on both cotton and polyester, as well as focused on specific materials from particularly emissionfriendly suppliers. In 2022, this was certainly more challenging, especially in light of the general and significant increase in raw material costs. In spite of this, we have chosen to go beyond these limits and take risks, e.g. by increasing sales prices, to ensure an increasingly sustainable product offering in line with our emission reduction targets. However, it is necessary to think in a large-scale perspective, without focusing on individual capsules, in order to strengthen partnerships with the most virtuous suppliers and respond to customers who are increasingly sensitive to sustainability issues.""

<question>: ""Does the transition plan include information on how it expects financial performance to change over time, given its strategy to achieve the objectives and priorities outlined?""
<paragraph>: ""We announced our new partnership in August 2022 at the Dallas Entrepreneur Center's Startup Week, the largest gathering of entrepreneurs and small businesses in North Texas. Texas Capital Bank had a table in 'Startup Alley,' and led a feature session about capital funding for small businesses. The panel included Effie Dennison, Head of Community Development and Corporate Responsibility at Texas Capital Bank; Janet Perez Shensky, SVP of Strategic Partnerships at Lendistry; and Tarsha Hearns, Senior Director at The DEC Network. INVESTING IN MINORITY DEPOSITORY INSTITUTIONS We're committed to working with minority depository institutions (MDIs), defined as a federally insured depository institution for which 51 percent or more of the voting stock is owned by minority individuals; or a majority of the board of directors is minority and the community that the institution serves is predominantly minority. In 2022, we continued to uphold this promise. We now work with 13 MDI partners nationwide. In 2022 we established a $5 million deposit relationship with OneUnited Bank, the nation's largest Black-owned bank.""

[Reason]: The paragraph does not provide any information about the transition plan's expectations for financial performance over time, given its strategy to achieve sustainability objectives and priorities. The text discusses the bank's partnership with minority depository institutions, its commitment to working with MDIs, and a specific example of a deposit relationship established with OneUnited Bank.

[Reason]: The paragraph provides some information about the company's financial position and performance in 2022, including its order backlog, financial position, and dividend proposal.

<paragraph>: ""Accidents and days lost (GRI 403-9) The manufacture of sanitary products can generally be said to have a low level of risks at the workplace. Nevertheless, there are still some individual activities which entail an increased risk of accidents. Typical workplace risks are the lifting and carrying of heavy loads, working at heights and in noisy environments, as well as handling hot surfaces and hazardous substances. As part of the Geberit Safety System, the workplace risks are assessed systematically and appropriate measures implemented to protect the employees. Geberit is consistently pursuing the creation of safe and clean workstations at the production plants. This is carried out, for example, by optimising and modernising the systems and processes (e.g. an appliance for deburring sharp sheet edges when manufacturing installation modules), the replacement of hazardous substances (e.g. substitution of the pickling process in the manufacture of metal fittings) and the reduction of dust and noise emissions (e.g. by using more efficient extraction devices and filters in ceramic production). Workstations are also being further optimised from an ergonomic point of view through the increasing use of robots or lifting aids.""

[Reason]: The paragraph provides information about Geberit's sustainability strategy, specifically in the area of water conservation, and mentions the purchase of certified green electricity in Slovenia and Italy.

The paragraph does not address the question of how Geberit expects its financial performance to change over time, given its strategy to achieve sustainability objectives.

When it comes to biodiversity management, we are guided by local regulations, with a commitment to minimizing our disturbance of the local biodiversity. The ISR method we currently use results in significantly less land disturbance than underground or open pit mining. Therefore, our operational footprint in Texas and Wyoming is quite small compared to conventional mining. This is primarily due to the lack of tailings produced in the ISR process compared to conventional mining. Tailings facilities, which hold radioactive material, are often tens of acres in size and must be maintained indefinitely. ISR contains no tailings and, therefore, does not require this additional land. Further, none of our permitted sites are in or near areas that hold protected conservation status or endangered species habitat, according to U.S. federal guidelines.""

Q: Your earliest memories of tigers? MUSIR: I grew up in the forest, on the edge of Gunung Leuser National Park, where my family farms nutmeg and patchouli. As a child I often heard tigers, saw their tracks, sometimes met them directly. But I never feared them, or considered them my enemy. I was taught by the elders that tigers are our nana, our grandmother, a benevolent force in our lives-and as important as humans. Every year we showed our respect with offerings of food. We honored taboos like not playing with dry palm leaves, whose rattle disturbs the tiger.""

UEC expects our management team, employees and contractors to be good stewards of the water we use in all phases of our operations, from exploration to restoration. Our operational sites do not face any withdrawal or scarcity risks and do not operate in regions with High or Extremely High Baseline Water Stress. All of our ISR projects use ore-hosted groundwater that does not meet primary or secondary drinking water standards and should only be used for industry. Our goal is to restore the orehosted groundwater back to pre-mining concentrations of metals, metalloids, cations and anions and total dissolved solids. To do this, we use reverse osmosis ('RO'), a water purification process that uses pressurized membranes to separate ions, unwanted molecules and larger particles from affected water. After processing through the RO unit, the treated water-roughly 75 percent of the groundwater used-is returned to the affected aquifer through injection wells.""

Our associates went above and beyond this goal by completing over 15 energy reduction projects in 2022. Projects completed include eliminating compressed air leaks and improving the efficiency of our lighting systems. In 2022, our total energy usage was 779,248 gigajoules (GJ). Our total scope 1 and 2 emissions were 80,397 metric tons CO$_{2}$ e. Total emissions decreased year-overyear primarily because we stopped production at several of our facilities and because our India facility received electricity from the grid instead of diesel generators. We reduced our emissions intensity by approximately 17% year over year 15. Our scope 3 emissions in 2022 were 1,503,000 metric tons CO$_{2}$e.""

CDP Plan and Program 28 SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2022 Energy reduction initiatives at the Suzhou facility The K&S Suzhou facility accounts for approximately 40% of total K&S global emissions, most of which come from the use of grid-sourced electricity. For this reason, particular importance is placed on reducing energy consumption at this site. A significant achievement during FY2022 was the installation of solar panels at the Suzhou plant. Operational since May 2022, the panels generated over 200 kWh of electricity during the fiscal year, representing approximately 4% of total K&S Suzhou energy use during the period the panels were active. In addition to installation of the solar panels, the K&S Suzhou plant has also implemented an Intelligent Energy Management System that enables live monitoring of energy use across various appliances, for example air conditioners and refrigeration equipment. If thresholds are exceeded, automatic alerts are provided to operators and remediating activities can be taken quickly.""

[Reason]: The paragraph provides some information about the organization's efforts to reduce energy consumption and implement sustainable practices at one of its facilities, specifically the Suzhou plant. It mentions the installation of solar panels and an Intelligent Energy Management System, which can help reduce the facility's carbon footprint. However, the paragraph does not directly address the question of the organization's resilience to climate-related scenarios or physical risks.

<background_information>: ""Meaning of the question: The question ""How resilient is the organization's strategy when considering different climate-related scenarios, including a 2°C target or lower scenario? How resilient is the organization's strategy when considering climate physical risks?"" is asking for information about the organization's preparedness and adaptability to potential future climate conditions and events. It seeks to understand how the organization's strategic planning accounts for the impacts of climate change, specifically aiming to limit global warming to 2°C above pre-industrial levels, as well as how it plans to manage and mitigate the physical risks posed by climate change, such as extreme weather events or sea-level rise.

Examples of information that the question is looking for:
1. Analysis of the organization's operational and financial exposure to climate-related risks and opportunities under different global warming scenarios, including a 2°C or lower scenario.
2. Details on the organization's short-term and long-term strategies to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and their alignment with international climate goals or agreements.
3. Information on the organization's investment in climate resilience, such as infrastructure improvements or technological innovations, to withstand climate physical risks.
4. Descriptions of scenario planning exercises or risk assessments the organization has conducted to evaluate the impact of various climate-related scenarios on its operations, supply chain, and market demand.

<paragraph>: ""Reuse of products and packaging materials (GRI 301-3) Due to their long service life and the way in which they are installed, Geberit products can only be reused or recycled to a very limited extent. A targeted improvement in recyclability can be achieved by using recyclable thermoplastics instead of nonrecyclable duroplast plastics, as is the case with the manufacture of a WC seat and lid at the plant in Pfullendorf (DE). In the case of packaging materials, Geberit's goal-also as part of eco-design workshops-is to keep amounts as low as possible, to continuously increase the share of recycled material, and to simplify the recycling and return processes. Efforts to reduce packaging amounts are already starting to bear fruit. For example, certain packaging levels are being omitted, bags reduced in size or thinner foils used, while instructions are printed directly on the packaging rather than on paper, or replaced by a QR code. In addition, care is being taken to avoid the use of polystyrene (EPS) wherever possible and, where necessary, to replace it with recyclable cardboard. A good example here is the  redesign of the packaging for the sanitary flush unit. Proven standard packaging-introduced as part of an effort to reduce complexity-is now also being reviewed. Since 2021, WC lids are shipped in cardboard boxes that have been reduced in size as far as possible. These boxes are almost four times lighter than those used previously, cause 70% fewer CO$_{2}$ emissions and are both easier to use and cheaper to procure. The packaging of the MasterFix fittings was also revised in the reporting year. The annual material savings amount to 1.8 tonnes of cardboard and 58,000 m$^{2}$of plastic foil-an area equivalent to around eight football fields. This results in a saving of around 24 tonnes of CO$_{2}$ per year.""

On average, a single lithium battery consumes 1,700 fewer kWh/year than a traditional lead battery, which results in an average reduction of 600 kilograms (0.6 metric tons) of CO$_{2}$ e emissions per year per battery. The lithium forklift fleet in Italy currently has nearly 300 operational units and is expected to grow by 10% in 2023. Across Europe, lithium-battery-powered forklifts will also begin replacing traditionally battery-powered forklifts as they reach the end of their useful lives.

<paragraph>: ""Harvest (October 2022) The first harvest was done strictly by hand and was also an opportunity for integration and collaboration among our people. The 40 OVS store managers in Sicily participated directly in the collection, in one of the fields, together with the other teams. Ginning Ginning, the process of separating the cotton fibre from the rest of the plant after harvesting, took place in Castel di Tusa, in the province of Messina, in the only plant currently present in Italy. The white flake is cleaned and then separated from the seeds, which account for about 60% of the flower mass. Spinning: from bales to thread The cotton bales were then transported from Messina to Salerno, at the SGL Filati plant, for the spinning operation, the most delicate phase that determines their quality and strength.""

<paragraph>: ""Rewilding Bison with Indigenous Partners From the Bronx Zoo to the Great Plains The bison, or buffalo, is an American conservation success story. In the 1800s, tens of millions roamed North America. Those numbers had plummeted to fewer than 1,100 animals when in the early 20th century, WCS sent Bronx Zoo-bred bison out west to re-establish the species in its native habitat. Together with Indigenous nations, we brought bison back from the edge of extinction. Today, WCS uses science-based solutions to conserve this species and supports Indigenous Peoples in maintaining viable populations so that bison can once again fulfill their essential ecological and cultural roles. In 2022, we sent six Bronx Zoo-born genetically pure bison to the Osage Nation's 17,400-hectare ranch in Oklahoma: to augment the genetics of the Osage's existing bison herd, and to help the tribe preserve their cultural heritage and the ecology of their ancestral lands. The return of bison to these lands benefits soil health, carbon storage, and the abundance and diversity of grassland plants, pollinators, amphibians, birds, and mammals, as well as revitalizing cultural and community well-being.""

<paragraph>: ""3 Excursion status means that the water quality has exceeded the permissible limits in either conductivity, chlorides and/or alkalinity which are parameters used to detect if injection fluid is leaving the wellfield. In the case of these five wells, the adjacent salt dome that has very high chlorides and conductivity has moved toward our monitor wells because of the constant bleed that is maintained. UEC is taking weekly samples, as opposed to the bimonthly requirement, but remediation is a challenge since this is not the injection fluid and the water cannot be pulled back. UEC will continue to monitor these wells twice a week and track the water quality. At the start of the new year, UEC will request the Texas Commission on Environmental Quality ('TCEQ') to reassess the status of the wells and if sampling can be returned to the normal schedule.""

[Reason]: The paragraph does not provide any information about the company's net-zero target or transition plan to reach it.

<paragraph>: ""TPI | 2022 ESG REPORT 34 In a continuation of our program, in 2022, we achieved our waste rate reduction goal (5% reduction during the year) by focusing our projects on optimizing direct material usage. This year, we had 59,881 metric tons of waste, of which 9,763 metric tons was hazardous and 50,118 metric tons was nonhazardous waste. Landfilled hazardous waste is disposed of through controlled confinement in a landfill that is lined, monitored, and in compliance with government regulations. We formed waste continuous improvement teams at each location, which completed waste stream analyses and developed waste reduction projects. 14 Hazardous waste disposal methods are confirmed by hazardous waste manifests. Non-hazardous waste disposal methods are confirmed based on vendor reports. Waste is reported based on shipment dates from our facilities. The other category includes waste disposed from cafeteria grease traps and using the U.S. EPA H141 code that is stored by the waste vendor and the disposal method is not provided to TPI.""

In FY2022 we fully implemented two hazardous waste reduction initiatives that had been piloted in FY2021. Treating waste acid for reuse · Waste hydrochloric acid from the product cleaning process is being redirected to our onsite WWTP and is used to adjust the alkalinity level of the resulting solution. This means that there has been a reduced need to acquire a purpose-bought chemical (previously sulfuric acid) and that there has been a reduction in the volume of waste acid that we need to treat and dispose of. There have also been associated cost savings. As a result of this initiative, we have reduced the volume of waste acid solution by approximately four tons per month.""

Geberit is aware of these effects and the associated responsibility. With its innovative solutions for sanitary products, Geberit aims to achieve sustained improvement in people's standard of living. The economy benefits from Geberit's leading role in the change towards a more sustainable sanitary industry: through the contribution to better sanitary and hygiene standards, a durable, resource-efficient sanitary infrastructure, through knowhow transfer in the sanitary industry, via impetus for the economy in regional economic areas, and through strong and longterm relationships with suppliers. There is no management approach to indirect economic impacts in the narrower sense. Instead, the company works with the stakeholders concerned to identify the best solutions in each case.""

I believe the paragraph is helpful for answering the question because it provides specific data on the company's Scope 3 emissions related to purchased goods and services, which is a key aspect of the question. The table provides a clear and concise overview of the company's performance in this area, which can be useful for understanding the scope of the company's indirect emissions.

[Reason]: The paragraph is not directly helpful in answering the question about the categories of Scope 3 emissions and their percentage of total emissions. The paragraph discusses the company's supplier sustainability program, which is a broader initiative that encompasses various aspects of sustainability, including ESG goals and supplier engagement.

The paragraph does not provide any information that directly addresses the question about Scope 3 emissions, which is the primary focus of the question. The paragraph is more focused on the company's supplier sustainability program and its goals, which are not directly related to the question.

[Reason]: The paragraph does not provide any information about the categories of Scope 3 emissions or the percentage of total emissions for the reporting period. The text appears to be discussing the company's charitable activities, its commitment to Myanmar, and its decision to maintain its presence in the country despite the challenging situation. The paragraph does not mention emissions or greenhouse gas emissions at all.

[Reason]: The paragraph provides some information about the company's Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions, but it does not directly address the question about Scope 3 emissions. The paragraph mentions the total energy consumption of the OVS Group, which is a relevant factor in calculating Scope 3 emissions, but it does not provide any information about the specific categories of Scope 3 emissions or the percentage of total emissions that they represent.

The paragraph does not provide any information about Scope 3 emissions, which is the main focus of the question. While it provides some information about the company's energy consumption, it does not provide the specific details about Scope 3 emissions that the question is seeking. Therefore, I believe that the paragraph is not helpful in answering the question.<|eot_id|>"

We have identified and implemented the following actions, among others: ¥ Require representative candidate slates for Vice President and above employee requisitions; ¥ Perform regular market checks to support pay competitiveness and parity and update cadence of periodic pay equity analyses to support internal efforts; ¥ Encourage company-sponsored Colleague Resource Groups (see 'Colleague Resource Groups' beginning on page 21); ¥ Maintain partnerships with networking organizations and recruitment platforms and partners that focus on diversity candidates; ¥ Invest in our internship programs as vehicles for building early-career, inclusive talent pipelines; and ¥ Maintain a dynamic Careers page on our website at www.haemonetics.com. Haemonetics is a member of the Healthcare Businesswomen's Association and we embrace their mission of furthering the advancement of women in healthcare. We are also proud that two women on our Global Leadership Team have been recognized by the Healthcare Businesswomen's Association as 'Rising Stars' in 2021 and 2022. We are pleased that The Boston Club's 2022 Census of Women Directors and Executive Officers recognized Haemonetics as one of only nine surveyed Massachusetts public companies with at least three women directors and three women executive officers. As we continue regular succession planning and develop our next generation of leaders, Haemonetics' strategic talent priorities will include an increased focus on representation of women and racially/ethnically diverse employees in leadership roles. Leveraging insights from our DEI efforts in calendar 2022, we plan to develop a multi-year DEI roadmap beginning in calendar 2023 that will identify programmatic goals and purposeful actions to execute on the strategy.""

<paragraph>: ""Sustainability → Sustainability performance report → Reporting Practice Reporting Practice GRI 3-1 Process of determining material topics Since 2006, Geberit has been reporting in accordance with the guidelines of the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI). In the present report, Geberit implements the current GRI Standards from 2021. The starting point is a  Materiality analysis that has been developed further over the years, which is based on the procedure described in the GRI Standards. An initial internal materiality analysis was thus developed in 2014 as part of workshops with individual members of the Group Executive Board and later approved by the Group Executive Board. The results were then reviewed and amended slightly by an external stakeholder panel. As part of the integration of the ceramics business, a comprehensive review was carried out in 2015. There were no major changes in the material topics. A further review and update of the material topics was carried out in 2018 as part of the switchover to the GRI Standards. In agreement with the Group Executive Board, the update of the materiality analysis in the reporting year focused on aligning it closely with the corporate strategy and sustainability strategy. The previously required listing of many individual GRI aspects was dispensed with. This resulted in fewer topics overall. The names of these topics are based on the corporate strategy and sustainability strategy, resulting in a consolidated name in some cases. The updated materiality analysis was reviewed and amended slightly by an external stakeholder panel in the reporting year. It became clear that a high degree of consensus existed between the internal standpoint of the company and the assessment of the stakeholder panel, see  Panel Statement. The finalised materiality analysis was checked and approved by the Group Executive Board and the Board of Directors.""

Through the use of this technology, SOAP is able to process up to 700 packages per hour, leading to reductions in resource and energy use. HOME SOAP and similar technologies reduce the use of packing materials and reduce package sizing. This allows shipments to use less space on delivery trucks, leading to reduced road miles traveled. Packaging sized to fit can also reduce the likelihood of products becoming damaged during shipping and can require less plastic to fill empty spaces in cartons. In addition to reducing product packaging materials, we also reduce the materials required for shipment packaging.""

[Reason]: The paragraph is not helpful for answering the question. The paragraph appears to be an introduction or a message from the CEO, highlighting the company's commitment to ESG (Environmental, Social, and Governance) and its achievements in this area. While it mentions receiving a high ESG rating and being named one of America's Most Responsible Companies, it does not provide specific targets or metrics related to climate-related risks and opportunities, which are the focus of the question.

[Guess]: No
[Confidence]: 0.9

The paragraph does not provide any concrete information that can help answer the question, which is seeking specific targets or metrics related to climate-related risks and opportunities. The paragraph is more focused on showcasing the company's commitment to ESG and its achievements, rather than providing actionable data or targets related to climate change.<|eot_id|>"

[Reason]: The paragraph provides information about the organization's waste diversion program, which is a specific target related to environmental sustainability.

The paragraph does not directly address the question's request for targets related to climate change mitigation, adaptation, or resilience. However, it does provide insight into the organization's environmental sustainability efforts, which can be indirectly related to climate change. The paragraph's information on waste diversion and the organization's progress towards its target can be seen as a positive step towards addressing climate-related risks and opportunities. Therefore, I believe the paragraph is partially helpful in answering the question, even though it does not fully address the question's request.<|eot_id|>"

This year, HARMAN completed a scope 3 screening using 2019 emissions data. This modeling project has helped us to better understand HARMAN's impact beyond our own operations. It has also helped to identify emissions hot spots in our supply chain and provide a complete baseline for measuring the impact of supply chain decarbonization initiatives over time. Emissions reduction efforts within our supply chain will require strong supplier partnerships and large-scale innovation, some of which are already underway (see more in our section on 'Collaboration', pages 19-20).""

Our management team is responsible for managing risk on a day-to-day basis and for bringing to the Board's attention material risks facing the company. The Board focuses on the quality and scope of Haemonetics' risk management strategies and considers the most significant areas of risk inherent in the company's business strategies and operations as well as the steps that management is taking to mitigate those risks. Additionally, Board committees consider discrete categories of risk relating to their respective areas of responsibility. All committees report to the full Board as appropriate, including when a matter rises to the level of a material or enterprise-level risk. Senior management has overall responsibility for Haemonetics' risk management approach. This responsibility includes identifying, evaluating and addressing potential risks that may exist at the enterprise, strategic, financial, operational, compliance and reporting levels. Haemonetics' Global Internal Audit function, which reports regularly to the Audit Committee, serves as the primary monitoring and testing function for compliance with company-wide policies and procedures. We believe that the division of risk management responsibilities described above constitutes an effective program for addressing the risks inherent in the operation of our company and the achievement of our business objectives.""

[Reason]: The paragraph is not helpful in answering the question because it appears to be a general overview of the company's environmental, social, and governance (ESG) report, discussing their vision, policy, and commitment to sustainability.

The paragraph does not provide any relevant information to answer the question, and it seems to be unrelated to the topic of carbon strategies. The text only mentions general statements about the company's commitment to sustainability and environmental protection, but it does not provide any concrete details about their carbon reduction efforts or strategies.<|eot_id|>"

<paragraph>: ""Eco Value: clear information for sustainable choices Over the years, we have strived to make the information available to customers more and more detailed, and from 2019, we have included, starting with a selection of products, information on the environmental impact of producing a garment at a glance. With Eco Value, three fundamental indicators can be known: (i) water consumption and (ii) CO$_{2}$ emissions from the product production phase, and (iii) the circularity index, a value ranging from 1 (least recyclable) to 10 (most recyclable), calculated on the basis of the number and type of materials and their recyclability. The index, stemming from a project in cooperation with the University of Padua, has been extended to 100% of the products on our e-commerce from 2021.""

[Reason]: The paragraph is not directly related to the question about carbon strategies, biofuels, carbon credits, and carbon removals. The text discusses Eco Value, a system that provides information on the environmental impact of producing a garment, including water consumption, CO2 emissions, and circularity index. While it mentions CO2 emissions, it does not provide information on the company's carbon strategies, preferred carbon credits, or the amount used.

[Guess]: No

The paragraph does not address the main concerns of the question, which are the company's carbon strategies, biofuels, carbon credits, and carbon removals. The text is focused on a specific aspect of sustainability, Eco Value, which is not directly related to the question.

Our Human Resources team reviews our compensation practices against the markets where we compete on a regular basis to ensure we are able to attract and retain top talent. COMPENSATION Haemonetics provides market-competitive base pay to compensate individuals for technical competencies required for their position and to help provide economic security. In addition to base salary, most of our employees have variable components to their compensation that are tied to achievement of corporate and individual performance goals, the fluctuations of our stock price, or a combination of both. We believe this approach fosters a pay-for-performance culture and, in the case of equity awards, helps to align the interests of employees and shareholders and promote a long-term shareholder perspective. Representatives of our Human Resources team conduct an annual risk assessment of Haemonetics' compensation programs and the findings are reviewed with the Compensation Committee. For fiscal 2022, the Compensation Committee agreed with management's conclusion that Haemonetics' compensation programs are designed with the appropriate balance of risk and reward in relation to Haemonetics' overall business strategy and do not create risk that is reasonably likely to have a material adverse effect on the company.""

<background_information>: ""Meaning of the question: The question ""What are the various carbon strategies - biofuel, carbon credits, carbon removals? what kind of verified carbon credits do they prefer and how much have they used?"" is asking for detailed information on the different methods and approaches a company employs to reduce or offset its carbon footprint. Specifically, it seeks clarity on the use of biofuels as a renewable energy source, the acquisition and use of carbon credits as a means to compensate for emissions, and the implementation of carbon removal techniques. Additionally, the question probes into the types of carbon credits the company prioritizes, focusing on their verification standards, and inquires about the quantity of these credits that have been utilized.

Examples of information that the question is looking for:
1. Detailed description of the company's investment in biofuel technology, including the types of biofuels used (e.g., ethanol, biodiesel) and the scale of their use within the company's operations.
2. Information on the company's strategy for purchasing carbon credits, including the criteria for selecting these credits (e.g., VCS, Gold Standard) and the reasons behind the preference for certain verification standards.
3. Data on the volume of carbon credits the company has purchased and retired in the reporting period, providing insights into the company's commitment to offsetting its carbon emissions.
4. Overview of carbon removal projects the company is involved in or supports, such as reforestation, direct air capture, or soil carbon sequestration, including the scale and impact of these initiatives.
5. Explanation of how the company's carbon strategy aligns with its overall sustainability goals and any relevant international or industry-specific carbon reduction commitments.
6. Insights into how the company evaluates the effectiveness and integrity of the carbon credits and carbon removal projects it invests in, including any third-party audits or certifications.""

When value transfers of non-cash assets occur through dividends to owners a liability is recognized in the consolidated accounts correspon ding to the fair value of the net assets subject to distribution at the point in time the AGM approves of the value transfer. The reported amount of the dividend liability corresponds to an equally sized reduction of Group equ ity. During the time between approval and distribution of the dividend the dividend liability is revalued to the current fair value with a corresponding revaluation recognized in equity. At the point in time the dividend is distri buted to the owners the dividend liability is derecognized while a revalua tion profit (loss) is recognized in consolidated profit/loss corresponding to the realized difference between the fair value distributed to the owners and the recognized value of distributed net assets.""

<paragraph>: ""The solution GXO introduced new processes to help our customer meet its net-zero carbon target by 2035 through reusing, recycling or sending away products for energy recovery. One of GXO's innovative solutions was a method of washing produce trays that uses cold water instead of hot. A change in the cleaning chemical and washing equipment allowed us to maintain the same level of quality and hygiene, all with cold water. Outcomes By reducing energy that would have been used to heat the water, we were able to deliver financial and environmental savings to the customer. Since 2009, the customer has sent zero waste directly to a landfill. Each week, GXO handles an average of 5,375 metric tons of cardboard and 410 metric tons of plastic waste and washes 4.4 million trays. Twelve GXO sites operating 24/7/365 and employing a staff of 900 make 1.3 million equipment repairs and wash 260 million trays and more than 11 million flower buckets annually.""

An environmental assessment concluded that the project would not significantly affect the quality of human health, safety and environment based on the 1,480 Ci/yr emission rate, given that the current emissions for the first half of 2022 are just 1.4 Ci. 3 Not relevant for UEC operations. 32 UEC 2022 Sustainability Report NYSE:  UEC Message from the CEO FY22 Highlights About UEC Our ESG Strategy Governance Environment Social ESG Performance 1 The reported values are for our Texas operations only. 2 UEC recycles approximately 95% of the groundwater during the production phase.

[Reason]: The paragraph appears to be discussing the environmental performance of Willow Creek's operations, specifically the effluent releases and environmental assessment. While it provides some information about the company's environmental impact, it does not seem to be related to the management of climate risks. The paragraph does not mention any tools, instruments, or strategies used to identify, assess, or mitigate climate-related risks.

[Guess]: No
[Confidence]: 0.9

The paragraph does not provide any information that is relevant to the question of what tools or instruments are being used to manage climate risks. The topic of the paragraph is more focused on environmental performance and effluent releases, which is not directly related to climate risk management.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>
