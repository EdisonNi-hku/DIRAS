<paragraph>: ""fit into this path?Garments handcrafted in a few months 10.000+Is the public sector playing its part?The public authority is one of the weakest players around. It takes forever before taking action. It must be understood that the non-profit sector has been used to being assisted by the public but this does not work. The dream of us parents is a co-design between the profit world, public authorities and non-profit organisations. It can be the economy of the future. What changes the vision of business is not the maximisation of profit, but of the common good.Has bureaucracy been simplified?Does the disability of children impact on parents? Does talking about a life project create resistance?create resistance? Projects like these can relieve families, because we take care of the child for many hours of the day. However, doing business as we try to do is more difficult. We want to set something in motion that actively involves families. Many see the non-profit as a service provider, but we are not. Parents who invest in their children must be active participants in the project.""

<question>: ""what are the social contributions or efforts mentioned?""
<paragraph>: ""It is a crescendo of attempts to bring the non-profit world closer to the profit world. Fashion experiments, studies products for disabled people, for example collections for wheelchair users. Others try to combine fragility and sustainability by creating a new strength. The for-profit world has realised that it is no longer enough to recover products, we must also recover people.From zero to half a thousand: what happens when solidarity becomes contagious? It was 2007 when six parents founded the association. Underlying this was the idea that everyone should do their share of the'investment'. Just as families had to put energy and passion into it, communities could engage in fundraising, while public bodies would play the role of facilitators. Businesses would eventually recognise the economic value of what we do. And so it went: in little more than ten years we have become a reference for 130 families, and then for another 200 who find answers for their children. Today we offer opportunities to work to more than 40 people with intellectual disabilities.""

CHARLES:The work I've been doing to reach young people-in primary schools, through social media, even running 55 kilometers dressed as a pangolin-gives me so much hope and joy. I see studentsbecoming pangolin champions: one kid went home and memorized every country where pangolins can be found.I also believe that with the right incentives, communities will become pangolin protectors.. One hunter told me his dream had been military service. He was doing something he didn't want to do because he saw it as his only way to survive. We need better law enforcement-more anti-poaching patrols and prosecutions-but we also need to create alternate ways for local people to benefit from the forest.""

This increase is also a reflection of the greater number of team members across the business.In the second half of FY22 we identified an increase in ladder related incidents, which had previously been on the decline. In response to this we are launching a follow-up ladder audit in the first quarter of FY23 to assess the ladders across the wider business and ensure all stores have safe and compliant ladders and that team members are trained on ladder use and risk identification.""

For this reason, we have and will continue to focus here because we can have a greater impact.We are also especially committed to understanding the risks within this category as it constitutes a strategic priority for the business as we plan for continued growth. Ensuring we implement strong risk assessment and due diligence processes is therefore critical.With greater visibility we have been able to improve the quality of our supplier data within this category, which in turn supported the more detailed modern slavery risk assessment that we undertook in the latter half of 2021. In the research conducted into the suppliers of our Accent owned brands, the majority of our suppliers in this category were rated inherently high for risks of modern slavery as their sourcing location was based on the country of manufacture, which for the suppliers of Accent owned brands is primarily in China. This enabled a more tailored risk assessment and deeper analysis which we are using to target our direct supplier engagement.""

<paragraph>: ""It is well known that we need to drastically reduce our dependence on fossil fuels in order to achieve the goal of limiting global warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius. But there is less awareness that we have natural solutions to the climate crisis available right now. For example, the earth's forests sponge up 30 percent of the carbon dioxide we release into the atmosphere each year-and they will keep doing this work for us if we make sure they are not cut down.In this section, you can read about how WCS is leading global efforts to advance nature-positive solutions to the climate crisis-from protecting the forests of the Congo Basin, the largest tropical net carbon sink on Earth, to conserving the peatlands of boreal Canada, which store even more carbon than intact forests. And since some of the effects of climate change are unavoidable, WCS is also working to help wildlife, ecosystems, and communities adapt to changing conditions.""

<paragraph>: ""DAN: Climate change fundamentally threatens our core mission to save wildlife and wild places; we've all seen the harm done by worsening droughts and wildfires. But WCS also brings distinctive strengths to solving this crisis. Forests remain our greatest climate asset; globally, they remove a third of the CO$_{2}$ emitted each year from burning fossil fuels. And most of that removal is done by the kind of high-integrity forests and peatlands WCS field programs help protect.With our on-the-ground presence in more than 50 countries-including thousands of staff working closely with governments and communities-WCS can be a significant piece of the global climate solution. The key is to bring financial investment into conservation in a whole new way. Intact forests keep the planet as much as a degree cooler than it would be without their help. If we value that natural climate control-which is worth tens of trillions of dollars to the global economy-we can create sustainable protections for these vital ecosystems, the wildlife they shelter, and the climate itself.""

<paragraph>: ""It is well known that we need to drastically reduce our dependence on fossil fuels in order to achieve the goal of limiting global warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius. But there is less awareness that we have natural solutions to the climate crisis available right now. For example, the earth's forests sponge up 30 percent of the carbon dioxide we release into the atmosphere each year-and they will keep doing this work for us if we make sure they are not cut down.In this section, you can read about how WCS is leading global efforts to advance nature-positive solutions to the climate crisis-from protecting the forests of the Congo Basin, the largest tropical net carbon sink on Earth, to conserving the peatlands of boreal Canada, which store even more carbon than intact forests. And since some of the effects of climate change are unavoidable, WCS is also working to help wildlife, ecosystems, and communities adapt to changing conditions.""

In particular, Appendix A requires that the entity carrying out the activity conducts an analysis to identify and assess its vulnerability to chronic and acute physical climatic risks, also evaluating adaptation solutions that can reduce these risks.OVS took a prudent approach and considered the activity to be non-aligned because there was insufficient evidence available for a complete and accurate assessment of compliance with the DNSH criterion.""

<paragraph>: ""Important sustainability issuesThe Nordic countries still have a long way to go to achieve carbon neutrality despite targets and plans for net zero emissions of greenhouse gases. The construction and real estate industries have a vital part to play in climate transition and are thereforedriving various initiatives to reduce carbon emissions in line with the Paris Agreement, particularly through the Road map for fossil free competitiveness that Peab has also signed onto. The construction and civil engineering industry, together with seven other trade organizations, work within the road map to achieve a climate neutral construction sector. This work comprises the entire value chain from planning and implementation to demolition and reuse.Creating sustainable cities includes energy efficient buildings and a construction process that uses material and processes in a climate-adapted manner. Looking at it from a broader perspective, cities' sustainability relies on energy-smart community planning with, for example, circular flows that lower climate impact.""

<paragraph>: ""DAN: Climate change fundamentally threatens our core mission to save wildlife and wild places; we've all seen the harm done by worsening droughts and wildfires. But WCS also brings distinctive strengths to solving this crisis. Forests remain our greatest climate asset; globally, they remove a third of the CO$_{2}$ emitted each year from burning fossil fuels. And most of that removal is done by the kind of high-integrity forests and peatlands WCS field programs help protect.With our on-the-ground presence in more than 50 countries-including thousands of staff working closely with governments and communities-WCS can be a significant piece of the global climate solution. The key is to bring financial investment into conservation in a whole new way. Intact forests keep the planet as much as a degree cooler than it would be without their help. If we value that natural climate control-which is worth tens of trillions of dollars to the global economy-we can create sustainable protections for these vital ecosystems, the wildlife they shelter, and the climate itself.""

The targeted reduction in emissions (Scopes 1 and 2) is equivalent to a contribution to a reduction path that limits CO$_{2}$ emissions to 'well below 2°C' above pre-industrial levels.A central element of the new CO$_{2}$ strategy is its integration in all relevant and existing business processes as well as the handling of CO$_{2}$ emissions as external costs by means of internal CO$_{2}$ pricing.""

<paragraph>: ""In the reporting year, the calculation of greenhouse gas emissions was updated with new basic data on the basis of the internationally recognised Ecoinvent database (version 3.8) and the IPCC (Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change) factors from 2013. Production-related process emissions are now also taken into consideration and, where possible, the effectively purchased local electricity mix (market-based) instead of the electricity mix of the respective country. Greenhouse gas emissions are calculated according to IPCC and are shown as a sum parameter (CO$_{2}$ equivalents or simply CO$_{2}$).Production emissions are recorded, calculated and analysed in detail as part of the corporate eco-balance. CO$_{2}$ emissions are particularly important to Geberit.  Other air emissions (NO$_{x}$, SO$_{2}$, hydrocarbons, etc.) are also recorded and calculated, but have a comparatively minor impact on the environment. The reduction of these emissions is directly related to the reduction targets of the CO$_{2}$ strategy.""

<question>: ""what the scope 3 says?""
<paragraph>: ""As a community builder Peab has broad and diversified operations. We are active in four Nordic countries with an extensive geographic presence as well as customers in both the private and public sectors. Our four business areas Construction, Civil Engineering, Industry and Project Development are independent but ensure through collaboration that we utilize local resources as far as possible in the form of our own personnel and input goods. In other words, Peab's business comprises many different kinds of activities that come under the EU taxonomy. At the same time Peab's operations are characterized by further conditions that provide the framework for how our reporting according to the EU taxonomy should be understood. Our operations are primarily carried out as projects where every project is unique, which makes evaluating each project demanding. In our construction and civil engineering operations customers by and large formulate the specifications of the project. This reduces Peab's ability to influence the outcome, even if we work actively with holding dialogues with customers early on. In addition, lead times are long in the industry-from zoning to completed project-and therefore it takes years before new requirements are realized in operations and reporting.""

<question>: ""what the scope 3 says?""
<paragraph>: ""The criteria for DNSH have been evaluated and Peab's ECO-products are considered to meet them.· Climate change adaptation: Considered met because we have performed climate risk and vulnerability analyses for all the manufacturing units of ECO-products and identified possible risk redu cing measures.· The sustainable use and protection of water and marine resources: Considered met because of compliance with valid laws since water activities and other situations that affect environment quality norms for water always require an Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) and taking relevant safeguards.· The transition to a circular economy: Considered met because Peab applies the industry's guidelines for waste management that steer towards sorting for possible material recycling. Peab also regularly evaluates the possibility of circular material flows concerning both input raw material for production and the recyclability of manufactured products. Examples of this are the binder Merit, based on slag which is a byproduct from the steel industry, our ECO-Ballast (ECO-Mineral aggregates) which is based on 100 percent reused raw material and is used in concrete and asphalt as well as reclaimed asphalt pavement as raw material in our paving production. There are EPDs for all our ECO-products.""

<question>: ""what the scope 3 says?""
<paragraph>: ""A wide range of measures for saving energy and increasing efficiency are planned at the plants. Accordingly, the area of ceramics, which accounts for around two-thirds of all Geberit's CO$_{2}$ emissions, has the largest structural savings potential. This includes a special focus on the reduction of scrap rates. The firing process and the use of the resulting waste heat will be further optimised. This can be used for other process steps, such as drying the cast plaster moulds or ceramic blanks. Furthermore, projects were launched to investigate the possibilities of switching to renewable energy sources-for example, ecologically produced hydrogen-in the long term as well as the systematic reuse of ceramic waste.Fuel consumption is determined primarily by the company's own and leased fleet of cars and delivery vans. Since early 2008, binding guidelines have also applied for the purchase of new vehicles. As of 2019, these guidelines were adjusted to take into account the new Worldwide Harmonised Light Vehicles Test Procedure (WLTP).""

<paragraph>: ""In general, all of the topics included in the materiality analysis and the associated goals and measures are constantly promoted, see  Sustainability strategy. The  Panel Statement confirms Geberit's perception-often expressed both internally and externally-that Geberit products are crucial for the added value of the company. Additionally, customers and other stakeholders are increasingly focusing on environmental and sustainability performance. The efficient handling of water remains one of the most important topics at Geberit. Saving water is directly linked to reducing energy consumption, which in turn indirectly reduces CO$_{2}$ emissions in the product use phase. The company has emphasised this link for years with reference to the  water footprint. Accordingly, Geberit's most significant contribution to climate change mitigation is then through water-saving solutions. An example of this is the new Acanto WC system solution with TurboFlush technology, which also features an extremely quiet flush and requires minimal cleaning.""

<paragraph>: ""Overall Scope 3 emissions were reduced by 6% compared to the previous year. OVS has defined Scope 3 emissionreduction targets on categories that are particularly relevant and where there is significant scope for action.As can be seen from the following table, thanks to an improved raw materials portfolio with a greater selection of low-impact materials and the reduction in the incidence of shipments by air, Scope 3 emissions decreased by 11% compared to 2019, substantially in line with the target of 12.6% defined by the objectives approved by SBTi. Considering the reduction per kg of product, the reduction is 12%.The significant reduction in transport emissions comes from the almost complete elimination of air transport. The slight upward shift from 2021 in emissions related to purchased Goods and Services should be read in light of the fact that in 2022, some purchases of finished goods were brought forward compared to the normal procurement curve typically adopted.""

<paragraph>: ""In general, all of the topics included in the materiality analysis and the associated goals and measures are constantly promoted, see  Sustainability strategy. The  Panel Statement confirms Geberit's perception-often expressed both internally and externally-that Geberit products are crucial for the added value of the company. Additionally, customers and other stakeholders are increasingly focusing on environmental and sustainability performance. The efficient handling of water remains one of the most important topics at Geberit. Saving water is directly linked to reducing energy consumption, which in turn indirectly reduces CO$_{2}$ emissions in the product use phase. The company has emphasised this link for years with reference to the  water footprint. Accordingly, Geberit's most significant contribution to climate change mitigation is then through water-saving solutions. An example of this is the new Acanto WC system solution with TurboFlush technology, which also features an extremely quiet flush and requires minimal cleaning.""

<paragraph>: ""Climate change has become one of the most severe and widespread threats to ecosystems worldwide. We are already seeing impacts, ranging from floods and fires to more intense storms and sea-level rise.While it is vital that we find ways to curb the climate crisis, helping wildlife, ecosystems, and communities adapt to changing conditions is also critical.A decade ago, WCS and the Doris Duke Charitable Foundation created the WCS Climate Adaptation Fund, which provides grants to conservation non-profits across the United States to catalyze innovative, science-driven climate adaptation projects-many of which serve as models that can be replicated around the globe.IMPACT: 123 climate adaptation projects launched across 48 states, commonwealths, territories, and tribal lands.Here are just a few ways in which the Climate Adaptation Fund has helped communities and wildlife adapt to changing conditions over the last decade.""

<paragraph>: ""It is well known that we need to drastically reduce our dependence on fossil fuels in order to achieve the goal of limiting global warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius. But there is less awareness that we have natural solutions to the climate crisis available right now. For example, the earth's forests sponge up 30 percent of the carbon dioxide we release into the atmosphere each year-and they will keep doing this work for us if we make sure they are not cut down.In this section, you can read about how WCS is leading global efforts to advance nature-positive solutions to the climate crisis-from protecting the forests of the Congo Basin, the largest tropical net carbon sink on Earth, to conserving the peatlands of boreal Canada, which store even more carbon than intact forests. And since some of the effects of climate change are unavoidable, WCS is also working to help wildlife, ecosystems, and communities adapt to changing conditions.""

<paragraph>: ""· Reflective window films, which reduce heat generated by solar gain, ambient temperature, and the reliance on air conditioning.· High-volume low-speed (HVLS) fans, which circulate air more efficiently than air conditioners.· Voltage reduction systems that return any unused power to the supply source, which reduces overall energy consumption for site operations.· Sensors, which enhance the energy efficiency of LED lighting by keeping lights off when areas are unoccupied and when natural lighting is sufficient.· Native landscaping, which can support local vegetation and pollinators and manage water use. Some sites go a step further and tend bees.· Demand side response technology, which adjusts a site's energy consumption when demand surges on the national grid. Shutting off commercial refrigeration during times of peak demand also reduces costs and CO$_{2}$e output.""

This process included identifying each of our individual emissions sources and creating an inventory of these sources and their emissions released in the year. We also began implementing energy efficiency measures at our Wyoming operations, starting with transitioning the entire lighting system to LED.It is important to note that, like much of the uranium industry, we operated at a reduced pace to capture residual uranium only during the period the assessment was done. We expect our emissions to increase once we go into production; however, this assessment provides us a good baseline to begin to understand our emissions profile. From this baseline we will""

And most of that removal is done by the kind of high-integrity forests and peatlands WCS field programs help protect.With our on-the-ground presence in more than 50 countries-including thousands of staff working closely with governments and communities-WCS can be a significant piece of the global climate solution. The key is to bring financial investment into conservation in a whole new way. Intact forests keep the planet as much as a degree cooler than it would be without their help.

<paragraph>: ""Q: How did you come to this work?DAN: I've focused on the intersection between forests and climate for more than 30 years, as a professor and then working in philanthropy. I came to WCS because I think, right now, it's where I can have the greatest impact-building on the unrivaled work of our field conservation programs and connecting those assets to global policy and financesolutions. It's clear that we are in no way separate from nature. Whether in the most remote regions or in the heart of a city, we are all linked to one another and to our animal relatives. We are mutually dependent. Africa's forest elephants, for instance, are like gardeners: they weed out smaller brush, which allows big trees to get bigger, locking away carbon.

<paragraph>: ""It is well known that we need to drastically reduce our dependence on fossil fuels in order to achieve the goal of limiting global warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius. But there is less awareness that we have natural solutions to the climate crisis available right now. For example, the earth's forests sponge up 30 percent of the carbon dioxide we release into the atmosphere each year-and they will keep doing this work for us if we make sure they are not cut down.In this section, you can read about how WCS is leading global efforts to advance nature-positive solutions to the climate crisis-from protecting the forests of the Congo Basin, the largest tropical net carbon sink on Earth, to conserving the peatlands of boreal Canada, which store even more carbon than intact forests. And since some of the effects of climate change are unavoidable, WCS is also working to help wildlife, ecosystems, and communities adapt to changing conditions.""

To fulfil our commitment, we have thus increased the recycled portion on both cotton and polyester, as well as focused on specific materials from particularly emissionfriendly suppliers. In 2022, this was certainly more challenging, especially in light of the general and significant increase in raw material costs. In spite of this, we have chosen to go beyond these limits and take risks, e.g. by increasing sales prices, to ensure an increasingly sustainable product offering in line with our emission reduction targets. However, it is necessary to think in a large-scale perspective, without focusing on individual capsules, in order to strengthen partnerships with the most virtuous suppliers and respond to customers who are increasingly sensitive to sustainability issues.""

Nevertheless, there are still some individual activities which entail an increased risk of accidents. Typical workplace risks are the lifting and carrying of heavy loads, working at heights and in noisy environments, as well as handling hot surfaces and hazardous substances. As part of the Geberit Safety System, the workplace risks are assessed systematically and appropriate measures implemented to protect the employees. Geberit is consistently pursuing the creation of safe and clean workstations at the production plants. This is carried out, for example, by optimising and modernising the systems and processes (e.g. an appliance for deburring sharp sheet edges when manufacturing installation modules), the replacement of hazardous substances (e.g. substitution of the pickling process in the manufacture of metal fittings) and the reduction of dust and noise emissions (e.g. by using more efficient extraction devices and filters in ceramic production).

Without them, we could not achieve the kind of results we share in this impact reportfrom promising gains for big cats and elephants, to robust forest protections in the Congo Basin and Mesoamerica, and much more. Shortly after I started at WCS in 2012, Hurricane Sandy devastated our New York Aquarium. More recently, we have all confronted the COVID-19 pandemic. Yet our five urban wildlife parks have come back from these challenges stronger. The aquarium is now fully reopened, with new exhibits that connect visitors to the wonders of marine life in the New York Seascape and beyond. Last year we welcomed more than 3.5 million guests to our four zoos and aquarium in New York City, offering new experiences and family favorites like the Bronx Zoo's World of Birds, which is celebrating its 50th anniversary.""

When it comes to biodiversity management, we are guided by local regulations, with a commitment to minimizing our disturbance of the local biodiversity. The ISR method we currently use results in significantly less land disturbance than underground or open pit mining. Therefore, our operational footprint in Texas and Wyoming is quite small compared to conventional mining. This is primarily due to the lack of tailings produced in the ISR process compared to conventional mining. Tailings facilities, which hold radioactive material, are often tens of acres in size and must be maintained indefinitely. ISR contains no tailings and, therefore, does not require this additional land.

<paragraph>: ""Wind R&D The increase of wind power installations is a result of the continuous improvement in turbine capacity factor (CF) which directly impacts the levelized cost of energy (LCOE) from wind. Increasing CF is due, in large part, to increasing rotor diameter meaning longer and more complex wind blade assemblies with increasing risk to both quality and product cost. To address this challenge, TPI has focused much of our wind technology efforts on the emerging field of computer vision and laser measurement with the use of artificial intelligence data processing to provide real-time feedback of key production metrics and collection of historical data. The immediate impact on product quality and cycle-time reduction is now well documented and implementation across global operations is underway.""

This program was designed to, among other things, improve product and service quality, reduce cost principally in our manufacturing and supply chain operations and ensure sustainability. Our Operational Excellence Program has helped contribute to overall reductions in our GHG emissions and energy by further rightsizing our geographic footprint, focusing manufacturing operations in locations with more energy-efficient power grids and upgrading our global facilities. For example, in fiscal 2022 we began the relocation of our Leetsdale, Pennsylvania manufacturing operations to a new Center of Excellence in Clinton, Pennsylvania. The Clinton facility incorporates several environmentally-focused features, including smart controls on the HVAC systems and a recycled compressor heat system for more efficient temperature control. During fiscal 2022, we also integrated Cardiva's Guaymas, Mexico plant into our manufacturing portfolio, which in 2019 received the Shingo Bronze Medallion for operational excellence.""

Q: Your earliest memories of tigers? MUSIR: I grew up in the forest, on the edge of Gunung Leuser National Park, where my family farms nutmeg and patchouli. As a child I often heard tigers, saw their tracks, sometimes met them directly. But I never feared them, or considered them my enemy. I was taught by the elders that tigers are our nana, our grandmother, a benevolent force in our lives-and as important as humans. Every year we showed our respect with offerings of food. We honored taboos like not playing with dry palm leaves, whose rattle disturbs the tiger.""

UEC expects our management team, employees and contractors to be good stewards of the water we use in all phases of our operations, from exploration to restoration. Our operational sites do not face any withdrawal or scarcity risks and do not operate in regions with High or Extremely High Baseline Water Stress. All of our ISR projects use ore-hosted groundwater that does not meet primary or secondary drinking water standards and should only be used for industry. Our goal is to restore the orehosted groundwater back to pre-mining concentrations of metals, metalloids, cations and anions and total dissolved solids. To do this, we use reverse osmosis ('RO'), a water purification process that uses pressurized membranes to separate ions, unwanted molecules and larger particles from affected water. After processing through the RO unit, the treated water-roughly 75 percent of the groundwater used-is returned to the affected aquifer through injection wells.""

<paragraph>: ""Reuse of products and packaging materials (GRI 301-3) Due to their long service life and the way in which they are installed, Geberit products can only be reused or recycled to a very limited extent. A targeted improvement in recyclability can be achieved by using recyclable thermoplastics instead of nonrecyclable duroplast plastics, as is the case with the manufacture of a WC seat and lid at the plant in Pfullendorf (DE). In the case of packaging materials, Geberit's goal-also as part of eco-design workshops-is to keep amounts as low as possible, to continuously increase the share of recycled material, and to simplify the recycling and return processes. Efforts to reduce packaging amounts are already starting to bear fruit. For example, certain packaging levels are being omitted, bags reduced in size or thinner foils used, while instructions are printed directly on the packaging rather than on paper, or replaced by a QR code. In addition, care is being taken to avoid the use of polystyrene (EPS) wherever possible and, where necessary, to replace it with recyclable cardboard. A good example here is the  redesign of the packaging for the sanitary flush unit. Proven standard packaging-introduced as part of an effort to reduce complexity-is now also being reviewed.

On average, a single lithium battery consumes 1,700 fewer kWh/year than a traditional lead battery, which results in an average reduction of 600 kilograms (0.6 metric tons) of CO$_{2}$ e emissions per year per battery. The lithium forklift fleet in Italy currently has nearly 300 operational units and is expected to grow by 10% in 2023. Across Europe, lithium-battery-powered forklifts will also begin replacing traditionally battery-powered forklifts as they reach the end of their useful lives.

<paragraph>: ""In August 2022, 20 K&S Santa Ana, USA team members volunteered to support Second Harvest Food Bank in upkeeping their bell pepper farming area, eradicating weeds growing in the cultivation area so that the harvest goes to those in need. To contribute towards zero waste and conservation of resources, K&S carries out regular recycling efforts such as in Santa Ana, CA, USA where about 9.5 kg of waste was collected to be recycled. In March 2022, three robots from our supplier in Israel were dismantled and recycled at the Ecology for a Protected Community plant, an ecological enterprise specializing in recycling electronic waste. Robots are a form of electronic waste, and improper disposal can lead to the leaching of toxic substances such as lead and mercury into our groundwater and soil. In addition to preventing environmental degradation, K&S hopes to strengthen the employment of people with disabilities. This ecological enterprise employs workers with disabilities, and it was an opportunity to contribute towards reducing stigmatization and ensuring a fair and inclusive workplace for all.""

<question>: ""what the scope 3 says?""
<paragraph>: ""The solution GXO introduced new processes to help our customer meet its net-zero carbon target by 2035 through reusing, recycling or sending away products for energy recovery. One of GXO's innovative solutions was a method of washing produce trays that uses cold water instead of hot. A change in the cleaning chemical and washing equipment allowed us to maintain the same level of quality and hygiene, all with cold water. Outcomes By reducing energy that would have been used to heat the water, we were able to deliver financial and environmental savings to the customer. Since 2009, the customer has sent zero waste directly to a landfill. Each week, GXO handles an average of 5,375 metric tons of cardboard and 410 metric tons of plastic waste and washes 4.4 million trays. Twelve GXO sites operating 24/7/365 and employing a staff of 900 make 1.3 million equipment repairs and wash 260 million trays and more than 11 million flower buckets annually.""

Spotlight: Consolidating the supplier network for an industrial customer The opportunity A major aerospace customer asked GXO to help improve efficiency in its supply chain, which was creating outsized costs and excessive delays. At the time, its supply chain comprised over 10,000 individual components from manufacturers across the U.S., and there were 36,000 shipments annually across the supply chain. The solution GXO's solution was to aggregate the demand from the customer and up to 300 of its Tier 1 suppliers for critical components, create a single forecast per part number back to the manufacturer and distribute the component supply effectively. Additionally, GXO opened a distribution center that is within 50 miles of 90% of the customer's Tier 1 suppliers.""

To achieve our goal of reducing the environmental footprint of our products, we collaborate with our customers to understand changing needs and requirements and build efficiency considerations into the design phase of our product development process. We adopt a Knowledge Driven Product Development (KDPD) framework comprising four stages from initial conception and market research through to product commercialization.""

HOME SOAP and similar technologies reduce the use of packing materials and reduce package sizing. This allows shipments to use less space on delivery trucks, leading to reduced road miles traveled. Packaging sized to fit can also reduce the likelihood of products becoming damaged during shipping and can require less plastic to fill empty spaces in cartons. In addition to reducing product packaging materials, we also reduce the materials required for shipment packaging.""
