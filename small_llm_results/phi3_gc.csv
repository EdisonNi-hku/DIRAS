<question>: ""what are the social contributions or efforts mentioned?""
<paragraph>: ""It is a crescendo of attempts to bring the non-profit world closer to the profit world. Fashion experiments, studies products for disabled people, for example collections for wheelchair users. Others try to combine fragility and sustainability by creating a new strength. The for-profit world has realised that it is no longer enough to recover products, we must also recover people.From zero to half a thousand: what happens when solidarity becomes contagious? It was 2007 when six parents founded the association. Underlying this was the idea that everyone should do their share of the'investment'. Just as families had to put energy and passion into it, communities could engage in fundraising, while public bodies would play the role of facilitators. Businesses would eventually recognise the economic value of what we do. And so it went: in little more than ten years we have become a reference for 130 families, and then for another 200 who find answers for their children. Today we offer opportunities to work to more than 40 people with intellectual disabilities.""

CHARLES:The work I've been doing to reach young people-in primary schools, through social media, even running 55 kilometers dressed as a pangolin-gives me so much hope and joy. I see studentsbecoming pangolin champions: one kid went home and memorized every country where pangolins can be found.I also believe that with the right incentives, communities will become pangolin protectors.. One hunter told me his dream had been military service. He was doing something he didn't want to do because he saw it as his only way to survive.

<paragraph>: ""PERFORMANCE AND PROGRESSWe aim for continuous safety improvement year on year across Accent Group through our training programs, emphasis on reporting and implementation of risk mitigation strategies.Our Lost Time Injury Frequency Rate (LTIFR) for FY22 was 2.6, which was a decrease from last year's LTIFR of 3.75.Total Recordable Injuries (TRI) increased from 79 last year to 101 this year and whilst we have seen an increase in TRI this year, there have been less incidents involving a team member being required to take time off work. This increase is also a reflection of the greater number of team members across the business.In the second half of FY22 we identified an increase in ladder related incidents, which had previously been on the decline. In response to this we are launching a follow-up ladder audit in the first quarter of FY23 to assess the ladders across the wider business and ensure all stores have safe and compliant ladders and that team members are trained on ladder use and risk identification.""

For this reason, we have and will continue to focus here because we can have a greater impact.We are also especially committed to understanding the risks within this category as it constitutes a strategic priority for the business as we plan for continued growth. Ensuring we implement strong risk assessment and due diligence processes is therefore critical.With greater visibility we have been able to improve the quality of our supplier data within this category, which in turn supported the more detailed modern slavery risk assessment that we undertook in the latter half of 2021. In the research conducted into the suppliers of our Accent owned brands, the majority of our suppliers in this category were rated inherently high for risks of modern slavery as their sourcing location was based on the country of manufacture, which for the suppliers of Accent owned brands is primarily in China. This enabled a more tailored risk assessment and deeper analysis which we are using to target our direct supplier engagement.""

The provided paragraph does seem to be helpful in answering the question, as it discusses specific actions taken by the organization to reduce its Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions, which are related to climate-related risks and opportunities. The paragraph also mentions the decrease in Florida's grid emissions factor due to the addition of renewable energy to the grid, which is an example of how the organization is aligning its performance with its strategy and risk management process in the context of climate change. However, the paragraph does not explicitly mention all the metrics used by the organization to assess climate-related risks and opportunities, nor does it fully explain how these metrics help ensure performance alignment with the organization's strategy and risk management process. Therefore, while the paragraph provides relevant information, it does not fully answer the question.

But there is less awareness that we have natural solutions to the climate crisis available right now. For example, the earth's forests sponge up 30 percent of the carbon dioxide we release into the atmosphere each year-and they will keep doing this work for us if we make sure they are not cut down.In this section, you can read about how WCS is leading global efforts to advance nature-positive solutions to the climate crisis-from protecting the forests of the Congo Basin, the largest tropical net carbon sink on Earth, to conserving the peatlands of boreal Canada, which store even more carbon than intact forests. And since some of the effects of climate change are unavoidable, WCS is also working to help wildlife, ecosystems, and communities adapt to changing conditions.""

<paragraph>: ""DAN: Climate change fundamentally threatens our core mission to save wildlife and wild places; we've all seen the harm done by worsening droughts and wildfires. But WCS also brings distinctive strengths to solving this crisis. Forests remain our greatest climate asset; globally, they remove a third of the CO$_{2}$ emitted each year from burning fossil fuels. And most of that removal is done by the kind of high-integrity forests and peatlands WCS field programs help protect.With our on-the-ground presence in more than 50 countries-including thousands of staff working closely with governments and communities-WCS can be a significant piece of the global climate solution. The key is to bring financial investment into conservation in a whole new way. Intact forests keep the planet as much as a degree cooler than it would be without their help. If we value that natural climate control-which is worth tens of trillions of dollars to the global economy-we can create sustainable protections for these vital ecosystems, the wildlife they shelter, and the climate itself.""

<paragraph>: ""Q: How did you come to this work?DAN: I've focused on the intersection between forests and climate for more than 30 years, as a professor and then working in philanthropy. I came to WCS because I think, right now, it's where I can have the greatest impact-building on the unrivaled work of our field conservation programs and connecting those assets to global policy and financesolutions. It's clear that we are in no way separate from nature. Whether in the most remote regions or in the heart of a city, we are all linked to one another and to our animal relatives. We are mutually dependent. Africa's forest elephants, for instance, are like gardeners: they weed out smaller brush, which allows big trees to get bigger, locking away carbon. A single elephant contributes to many additional tons of CO$_{2}$ storage, helping regulate our climate. As an ecosystem ecologist, I think of species as parts of a larger system, and that's true of humans as well.""

The provided paragraph does seem to be helpful in answering the question. It mentions that risk monitoring, including risks associated with climate change, is part of the company's regular reporting and risk assessment processes. This indicates that the organization is aware of climate-related risks and considers them in its overall risk management. Additionally, the paragraph references the TCFD Reporting, which includes a chart on ESG governance, suggesting that the organization has a structured approach to managing environmental, social, and governance issues, including climate-related risks. However, the paragraph does not explicitly discuss the organization's resilience strategy in the context of a 2°C target or lower scenario or detail how it manages climate physical risks. Therefore, while the paragraph provides some relevant information, it does not fully answer the question. My confidence is high (0.95) because the paragraph does indicate that the organization considers climate-related risks in its governance and risk management, which is a component of resilience.<|end|>"

The provided paragraph does seem to be helpful in answering the question. It discusses the organization's commitment to reducing greenhouse gas emissions, which is a part of the broader climate resilience strategy. The mention of an emissions baseline, reduction goals, and a decarbonization roadmap indicates that the organization is actively planning for climate-related scenarios, including the 2°C target or lower scenario. Furthermore, the paragraph touches on the organization's efforts to minimize environmental impacts and integrate sustainability into business decisions, which are relevant to understanding the organization's resilience to climate physical risks.

The provided paragraph does discuss risk management and the Enterprise Risk Management (ERM) program, which is relevant to the question about identifying and assessing climate-related risks. However, it does not explicitly mention climate-related risks or the specific processes used to identify and assess them. The mention of ERM and ERA suggests that the organization has a structured approach to risk management, which could include climate-related risks. Given the context, it is reasonable to infer that the ERM program would encomp

- answer: include climate-related risks, but the paragraph does not provide explicit details on the processes for identifying and assessing climate-related risks. Therefore, while the paragraph is somewhat helpful, it does not fully answer the question.

[Confidence]: 0.95

The confidence is high because the ERM program is a comprehensive risk management framework that would likely cover climate-related risks. However, the lack of explicit mention of climate-related processes in the paragraph means there is a slight uncertainty, hence the confidence is not absolute.<|end|>"

I came to WCS because I think, right now, it's where I can have the greatest impact-building on the unrivaled work of our field conservation programs and connecting those assets to global policy and financesolutions. It's clear that we are in no way separate from nature. Whether in the most remote regions or in the heart of a city, we are all linked to one another and to our animal relatives. We are mutually dependent. Africa's forest elephants, for instance, are like gardeners: they weed out smaller brush, which allows big trees to get bigger, locking away carbon. A single elephant contributes to many additional tons of CO$_{2}$ storage, helping regulate our climate. As an ecosystem ecologist, I think of species as parts of a larger system, and that's true of humans as well.""

The provided paragraph does indeed address the question of what processes the organization uses to identify and assess climate-related risks. It mentions the implementation of TCFD's recommendations and the structured reporting of climate-related risks and opportunities, which implies the use of specific methods or tools. Additionally, it references the annual CDP Climate Report, suggesting a regular assessment process. However, the paragraph does not detail the specific tools, strategies, or frequency of these assessments, which means it does not fully answer the question but still provides relevant information.<|end|>"

<paragraph>: ""Important sustainability issuesThe Nordic countries still have a long way to go to achieve carbon neutrality despite targets and plans for net zero emissions of greenhouse gases. The construction and real estate industries have a vital part to play in climate transition and are thereforedriving various initiatives to reduce carbon emissions in line with the Paris Agreement, particularly through the Road map for fossil free competitiveness that Peab has also signed onto. The construction and civil engineering industry, together with seven other trade organizations, work within the road map to achieve a climate neutral construction sector. This work comprises the entire value chain from planning and implementation to demolition and reuse.Creating sustainable cities includes energy efficient buildings and a construction process that uses material and processes in a climate-adapted manner. Looking at it from a broader perspective, cities' sustainability relies on energy-smart community planning with, for example, circular flows that lower climate impact.""

<paragraph>: ""DAN: Climate change fundamentally threatens our core mission to save wildlife and wild places; we've all seen the harm done by worsening droughts and wildfires. But WCS also brings distinctive strengths to solving this crisis. Forests remain our greatest climate asset; globally, they remove a third of the CO$_{2}$ emitted each year from burning fossil fuels. And most of that removal is done by the kind of high-integrity forests and peatlands WCS field programs help protect.With our on-the-ground presence in more than 50 countries-including thousands of staff working closely with governments and communities-WCS can be a significant piece of the global climate solution. The key is to bring financial investment into conservation in a whole new way. Intact forests keep the planet as much as a degree cooler than it would be without their help. If we value that natural climate control-which is worth tens of trillions of dollars to the global economy-we can create sustainable protections for these vital ecosystems, the wildlife they shelter, and the climate itself.""

The provided paragraph does seem to be helpful in answering the question. It mentions the company's commitment to addressing climate-related risks and opportunities, aligning with TCFD recommendations, conducting a climate-risk assessment, developing a decarbonization roadmap, and setting science-based targets. These actions suggest that the company has a clear net-zero target and a transition plan to reach it. The mention of a decarbonization roadmap and setting science-based targets indicates that the company is actively working on a strategy to reduce its emissions, which is a key component of a transition plan. However, the paragraph does not explicitly state the specific year by which the company aims to achieve net-zero greenhouse gas emissions, which is one of the examples provided in the background information.

The provided paragraph does seem to be helpful in answering the question, as it mentions the existence of an ESG steering group that drives the company's commitment to the environment, health, safety, and sustainability. This group is responsible for aligning business strategies with evolving ESG strategies, which likely includes setting and pursuing net-zero targets. However, the paragraph does not explicitly state a net-zero target or provide details on the transition plan to reach it. Therefore, while the paragraph is relevant and provides some context, it does not fully answer the question.

The provided paragraph does indicate that the company has a Carbon Management Program and is actively working on reducing GHG emissions, which suggests that they have a net-zero target and a transition plan. The mention of specific GHG Protocol categories and the intention to collect data on Scope 3 emissions also implies that the company is taking steps to outline and implement a detailed strategy to reach their net-zero goal. However, the paragraph does not explicitly state the specific year by which the company aims to achieve net-zero emissions, which is one of the examples of information the background information suggests the question is looking for. Despite this, the paragraph is still quite helpful in answering the question, hence the high confidence score.<|end|>"

<paragraph>: ""The Geberit Group stands for an ambitious and implementation-oriented approach in its activities. This also applies to the new CO$_{2}$ strategy developed in 2021 and implemented in the reporting year.. The goal in the future is to continue to reduce CO$_{2}$ intensity by an average of 5% per year. As such, Geberit is looking to achieve a long-term reduction in absolute CO$_{2}$ emissions from 183,886 tonnes in 2021 to 121,000 tonnes by 2035. In comparison with the reference year 2015, relative CO$_{2}$ emissions are to be reduced by 70% by 2030 and by 80% by 2035, while absolute CO$_{2}$ emissions are to fall by 47% and 50% by 2030 and 2035 respectively. The targeted reduction in emissions (Scopes 1 and 2) is equivalent to a contribution to a reduction path that limits CO$_{2}$ emissions to 'well below 2°C' above pre-industrial levels.A central element of the new CO$_{2}$ strategy is its integration in all relevant and existing business processes as well as the handling of CO$_{2}$ emissions as external costs by means of internal CO$_{2}$ pricing.""

The provided paragraph does seem to be helpful in answering the question. It mentions that the company has set reduction targets according to scientific parameters and in line with the Science Based Targets initiative, which implies a commitment to reducing greenhouse gas emissions. The specific target of a 46.2% reduction by 2030 is also stated, which answers part of the question regarding the specific year by which the company aims to achieve net-zero greenhouse gas emissions.

However, the paragraph does not explicitly mention a ""clearly stated net-zero target"" or a ""transition plan"" to reach it. It does discuss the use of more sustainable materials and processes, which could be part of a transition plan, but it does not provide a detailed roadmap or outline of actions to achieve the net-zero goal.

Despite this, the information given does indicate that the company is actively working towards reducing its emissions and aligning its targets with recognized scientific guidelines, which is relevant to the question. Therefore, I am quite confident that the paragraph is helpful, but it does not fully answer the question as it lacks explicit details on the transition plan.<|end|>"

The provided paragraph does contain information that is relevant to the question. It mentions that Fidelity National Finans (FNF) insures green energy projects, which include solar and wind energy production projects, hydrogen energy production projects, and battery storage facilities. This information suggests that FNF is involved in supporting renewable energy sources, which is a component of a transition plan towards net-zero emissions. However, the paragraph does not explicitly state a net-zero target or provide details on the transition plan to reach it. The confidence score is high because the paragraph does indicate involvement in green energy projects, which is related to the transition plan, but it does not fully answer the question.<|end|>"

The provided paragraph does indeed contain information relevant to the question ""what the scope 3 says?"" Specifically, it mentions ""Scope 3 (Other Indirect Emissions): GlobalGRI 305-3 Third-party Verification 2021 data,"" which directly addresses the concept of Scope 3 emissions. The paragraph also provides context about the scope 3 emissions, mentioning that they are indirect emissions from sources not owned or controlled by the company, which aligns with the background information provided. Although the paragraph does not list all the examples of Scope 3 emissions, it does give a clear indication of what Scope 3 entails and mentions the existence of third-party verification for these emissions. Therefore, the paragraph is helpful for answering the question, and my confidence in this assessment is high.<|end|>"

<paragraph>: ""As a community builder Peab has broad and diversified operations. We are active in four Nordic countries with an extensive geographic presence as well as customers in both the private and public sectors. Our four business areas Construction, Civil Engineering, Industry and Project Development are independent but ensure through collaboration that we utilize local resources as far as possible in the form of our own personnel and input goods. In other words, Peab's business comprises many different kinds of activities that come under the EU taxonomy. At the same time Peab's operations are characterized by further conditions that provide the framework for how our reporting according to the EU taxonomy should be understood. Our operations are primarily carried out as projects where every project is unique, which makes evaluating each project demanding. In our construction and civil engineering operations customers by and large formulate the specifications of the project. This reduces Peab's ability to influence the outcome, even if we work actively with holding dialogues with customers early on. In addition, lead times are long in the industry-from zoning to completed project-and therefore it takes years before new requirements are realized in operations and reporting.""

The provided paragraph does not directly address the question about the scope 3 emissions.

The paragraph's focus on the company's operations and the EU taxonomy does not seem to contain the necessary details to answer the question about Scope 3 emissions. However, the mention of ""every project is unique"" and ""long lead times"" could imply that there are indirect emissions associated with these projects, but this is not explicitly stated. Therefore, I am very confident that the paragraph is not helpful in answering the question about Scope 3 emissions.<|end|>"

<paragraph>: ""The criteria for DNSH have been evaluated and Peab's ECO-products are considered to meet them.· Climate change adaptation: Considered met because we have performed climate risk and vulnerability analyses for all the manufacturing units of ECO-products and identified possible risk redu cing measures.· The sustainable use and protection of water and marine resources: Considered met because of compliance with valid laws since water activities and other situations that affect environment quality norms for water always require an Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) and taking relevant safeguards.· The transition to a circular economy: Considered met because Peab applies the industry's guidelines for waste management that steer towards sorting for possible material recycling. Peab also regularly evaluates the possibility of circular material flows concerning both input raw material for production and the recyclability of manufactured products. Examples of this are the binder Merit, based on slag which is a byproduct from the steel industry, our ECO-Ballast (ECO-Mineral aggregates) which is based on 100 percent reused raw material and is used in concrete and asphalt as well as reclaimed asphalt pavement as raw material in our paving production.

Accordingly, the area of ceramics, which accounts for around two-thirds of all Geberit's CO$_{2}$ emissions, has the largest structural savings potential. This includes a special focus on the reduction of scrap rates. The firing process and the use of the resulting waste heat will be further optimised. This can be used for other process steps, such as drying the cast plaster moulds or ceramic blanks. Furthermore, projects were launched to investigate the possibilities of switching to renewable energy sources-for example, ecologically produced hydrogen-in the long term as well as the systematic reuse of ceramic waste.Fuel consumption is determined primarily by the company's own and leased fleet of cars and delivery vans. Since early 2008, binding guidelines have also applied for the purchase of new vehicles.

Material risks and their financial significance are regularly reviewed and assessed by Geberit as part of risk management.Physical risks include short-term acute, extreme weather events and longer-term chronic, localised effects such as increasing average temperatures, rising sea levels or increasing periods of drought. These short-term and longer-term effects may result in damage to property and infrastructure, adversely affect logistics operations or cause disruptions in the supply chain. Rising average temperatures and an increase in the number of hot days lead to increased energy demand for the cooling of machines, processes and workplaces during the summer months, as well as to a possible reduction in energy demand for heating buildings in the winter. Rising sea levels may mean that production sites located on the sea have to be protected against flooding.""

<paragraph>: ""Overall Scope 3 emissions were reduced by 6% compared to the previous year. OVS has defined Scope 3 emissionreduction targets on categories that are particularly relevant and where there is significant scope for action.As can be seen from the following table, thanks to an improved raw materials portfolio with a greater selection of low-impact materials and the reduction in the incidence of shipments by air, Scope 3 emissions decreased by 11% compared to 2019, substantially in line with the target of 12.6% defined by the objectives approved by SBTi. Considering the reduction per kg of product, the reduction is 12%.The significant reduction in transport emissions comes from the almost complete elimination of air transport. The slight upward shift from 2021 in emissions related to purchased Goods and Services should be read in light of the fact that in 2022, some purchases of finished goods were brought forward compared to the normal procurement curve typically adopted.""

The paragraph provided does address the question by identifying specific categories of Scope 3 emissions that the company reports on (GHG Protocol categories 1, 2, 4, and 6). It also mentions that the company will be collecting data relating to these categories in FY2023, which implies that they are tracking and reporting on these emissions. However, the paragraph does not explicitly state the percentage of total emissions that these Scope 3 emissions represent for the reporting period. Given the context and the information provided, it is reasonable to infer that the company is indeed reporting on the percentage of total emissions that are Scope 3, but this specific detail is not directly mentioned. Therefore, the paragraph is mostly helpful for answering the question, but with a slight deduction in confidence due to the lack of explicit percentage information.<|end|>"

But WCS also brings distinctive strengths to solving this crisis. Forests remain our greatest climate asset; globally, they remove a third of the CO$_{2}$ emitted each year from burning fossil fuels. And most of that removal is done by the kind of high-integrity forests and peatlands WCS field programs help protect.With our on-the-ground presence in more than 50 countries-including thousands of staff working closely with governments and communities-WCS can be a significant piece of the global climate solution. The key is to bring financial investment into conservation in a whole new way. Intact forests keep the planet as much as a degree cooler than it would be without their help. If we value that natural climate control-which is worth tens of trillions of dollars to the global economy-we can create sustainable protections for these vital ecosystems, the wildlife they shelter, and the climate itself.""

<paragraph>: ""Q: How did you come to this work?DAN: I've focused on the intersection between forests and climate for more than 30 years, as a professor and then working in philanthropy. I came to WCS because I think, right now, it's where I can have the greatest impact-building on the unrivaled work of our field conservation programs and connecting those assets to global policy and financesolutions. It's clear that we are in no way separate from nature. Whether in the most remote regions or in the heart of a city, we are all linked to one another and to our animal relatives. We are mutually dependent. Africa's forest elephants, for instance, are like gardeners: they weed out smaller brush, which allows big trees to get bigger, locking away carbon. A single elephant contributes to many additional tons of CO$_{2}$ storage, helping regulate our climate. As an ecosystem ecologist, I think of species as parts of a larger system, and that's true of humans as well.""

This is an initiative promoted by the Ministry of the Environment, Water and Ecological Transition, which seeks the active participation of industry to achieve the climate goals and objectives established in the first Nationally Determined Contribution of Ecuador to a carbon emissions reduction target of 22.5% by 2025 for the country.There are three stages to our strategy to reduce our carbon emissions:In the reporting period under review, SolGold has made significant strides to measure the necessary metrics to disclose our verified and validated emissions.SUSTAINABILITY REPORT CONTINUEDGreenhouse gas ('GHG ') emissionsSolGold has carried out the measurement of greenhouse gases ('GHG ') as detailed in the Carbon Reporting section of the Corporate Governance report. GHG emissions were measured from the operation of the Cascabel project and main exploration projects in Ecuador that can vary from year to year. There is a small margin of error in 2022 given the emissions produced from exploration activity in Sharug was not included.""

The provided paragraph does address aspects of the question, particularly in the context of risk assessment and ethical business practices. It mentions the Enterprise Risk Assessment (ERA) program and how it identifies and mitigates risks, which could include financial risks associated with the transition to sustainability. The mention of ""Supply Chain Interruptions"" and ""Export Compliance Adherence"" as key risks where corruption has been identified as a more significant factor could imply that the company is considering the financial implications of its sustainability transition. However, the paragraph does not explicitly mention financial performance projections or expectations, which are directly asked in the question.

<paragraph>: ""We could have done better, but purchases of organic cotton have decreased due to less availability on the market. To fulfil our commitment, we have thus increased the recycled portion on both cotton and polyester, as well as focused on specific materials from particularly emissionfriendly suppliers. In 2022, this was certainly more challenging, especially in light of the general and significant increase in raw material costs. In spite of this, we have chosen to go beyond these limits and take risks, e.g. by increasing sales prices, to ensure an increasingly sustainable product offering in line with our emission reduction targets. However, it is necessary to think in a large-scale perspective, without focusing on individual capsules, in order to strengthen partnerships with the most virtuous suppliers and respond to customers who are increasingly sensitive to sustainability issues.""

The provided paragraph does not directly address the question of whether the transition plan includes information on how financial performance is expected to change over time. While it does mention challenges related to raw material costs and the company's response to these challenges, it does not explicitly discuss financial projections, expected changes in financial performance, or any specific financial metrics related to the sustainability transition. The paragraph focuses more on the company' power to take risks and strengthen partnerships, rather than providing detailed financial information. However, the mention of increased sales prices and sustainability targets could be indirectly related to financial performance, but it is not a direct answer to the question. Therefore, I am 95% confident that the paragraph is not helpful in answering the question as it stands.<|end|>"

<paragraph>: ""Accidents and days lost (GRI 403-9) The manufacture of sanitary products can generally be said to have a low level of risks at the workplace. Nevertheless, there are still some individual activities which entail an increased risk of accidents. Typical workplace risks are the lifting and carrying of heavy loads, working at heights and in noisy environments, as well as handling hot surfaces and hazardous substances. As part of the Geberit Safety System, the workplace risks are assessed systematically and appropriate measures implemented to protect the employees. Geberit is consistently pursuing the creation of safe and clean workstations at the production plants. This is carried out, for example, by optimising and modernising the systems and processes (e.g. an appliance for deburring sharp sheet edges when manufacturing installation modules), the replacement of hazardous substances (e.g. substitution of the pickling process in the manufacture of metal fittings) and the reduction of dust and noise emissions (e.g. by using more efficient extraction devices and filters in ceramic production). Workstations are also being further optimised from an ergonomic point of view through the increasing use of robots or lifting aids.""

When it comes to biodiversity management, we are guided by local regulations, with a commitment to minimizing our disturbance of the local biodiversity. The ISR method we currently use results in significantly less land disturbance than underground or open pit mining. Therefore, our operational footprint in Texas and Wyoming is quite small compared to conventional mining. This is primarily due to the lack of tailings produced in the ISR process compared to conventional mining. Tailings facilities, which hold radioactive material, are often tens of acres in size and must be maintained indefinitely. ISR contains no tailings and, therefore, does not require this additional land. Further, none of our permitted sites are in or near areas that hold protected conservation status or endangered species habitat, according to U.S. federal guidelines.""

<paragraph>: ""Wind R&D The increase of wind power installations is a result of the continuous improvement in turbine capacity factor (CF) which directly impacts the levelized cost of energy (LCOE) from wind. Increasing CF is due, in large part, to increasing rotor diameter meaning longer and more complex wind blade assemblies with increasing risk to both quality and product cost. To address this challenge, TPI has focused much of our wind technology efforts on the emerging field of computer vision and laser measurement with the use of artificial intelligence data processing to provide real-time feedback of key production metrics and collection of historical data. The immediate impact on product quality and cycle-time reduction is now well documented and implementation across global operations is underway.""

UEC expects our management team, employees and contractors to be good stewards of the water we use in all phases of our operations, from exploration to restoration. Our operational sites do not face any withdrawal or scarcity risks and do not operate in regions with High or Extremely High Baseline Water Stress. All of our ISR projects use ore-hosted groundwater that does not meet primary or secondary drinking water standards and should only be used for industry. Our goal is to restore the orehosted groundwater back to pre-mining concentrations of metals, metalloids, cations and anions and total dissolved solids. To do this, we use reverse osmosis ('RO'), a water purification process that uses pressurized membranes to separate ions, unwanted molecules and larger particles from affected water. After processing through the RO unit, the treated water-roughly 75 percent of the groundwater used-is returned to the affected aquifer through injection wells.""

The provided paragraph does offer some insights into the organization's strategy for climate-related scenarios, specifically mentioning energy reduction initiatives and the installation of solar panels at the Suzhou facility. This information is relevant to understanding the organization's resilience to climate physical risks, as it demonstrates a proactive approach to reducing energy consumption and incorporating renewable energy sources, which can be part of the organization's strategy to mitigate physical climate risks. However, the paragraph does not directly address the organization's preparedness for different climate-related scenarios, including a 2°C target or lower scenario, nor does it provide a comprehensive view of the organization's overall strategy for climate resilience. Therefore, while the paragraph is somewhat helpful, it does not fully answer the question.

The provided paragraph does seem to be helpful in answering the question, as it discusses the organization's efforts in integrating environmental management practices into their operations, which is a part of building resilience to climate-related scenarios. It mentions LEED® certified buildings, sustainable solutions encouragement, and programs for energy efficiency, water conservation, and waste management. These points suggest that the organization is considering climate-related scenarios and physical risks, although the paragraph does not explicitly mention a 2°C target or lower scenario or detail how the organization's strategy is resilient to such specific scenarios. However, the information given does indicate a level of preparedness and adaptability, which is relevant to the question. The confidence score is high because the paragraph does touch on aspects of the question, but it lacks specific details about the 2°C target or lower scenario and the organization's strategy's resilience to climate physical risks.<|end|>"

<paragraph>: ""Reuse of products and packaging materials (GRI 301-3) Due to their long service life and the way in which they are installed, Geberit products can only be reused or recycled to a very limited extent. A targeted improvement in recyclability can be achieved by using recyclable thermoplastics instead of nonrecyclable duroplast plastics, as is the case with the manufacture of a WC seat and lid at the plant in Pfullendorf (DE). In the case of packaging materials, Geberit's goal-also as part of eco-design workshops-is to keep amounts as low as possible, to continuously increase the share of recycled material, and to simplify the recycling and return processes. Efforts to reduce packaging amounts are already starting to bear fruit. For example, certain packaging levels are being omitted, bags reduced in size or thinner foils used, while instructions are printed directly on the packaging rather than on paper, or replaced by a QR code. In addition, care is being taken to avoid the use of polystyrene (EPS) wherever possible and, where necessary, to replace it with recyclable cardboard. A good example here is the  redesign of the packaging for the sanitary flush unit. Proven standard packaging-introduced as part of an effort to reduce complexity-is now also being reviewed. Since 2021, WC lids are shipped in cardboard boxes that have been reduced in size as far as possible. These boxes are almost four times lighter than those used previously, cause 70% fewer CO$_{2}$ emissions and are both easier to use and cheaper to procure. The packaging of the MasterFix fittings was also revised in the reporting year. The annual material savings amount to 1.8 tonnes of cardboard and 58,000 m$^{2}$of plastic foil-an area equivalent to around eight football fields. This results in a saving of around 24 tonnes of CO$_{2}$ per year.""

The provided paragraph discusses the organization's efforts in reducing packaging materials and improving recyclability, which is a part of the organization's sustainability strategy. While it does not directly address the organization's resilience to climate-related scenarios or physical climate risks, the information about reducing material use and improving recyclability can be seen as a component of the organization's overall resilience strategy. The paragraph indicates that the organization is actively working on reducing its environmental footprint, which could be related to its preparedness for climate change impacts. However, the paragraph does not explicitly mention climate-related scenarios or physical climate risks, so the information is somewhat indirect. Given the context, I am highly confident that the paragraph is helpful in providing some insight into the organization's resilience strategy, but it does not fully answer the question.<|end|>"

<paragraph>: ""Rewilding Bison with Indigenous Partners From the Bronx Zoo to the Great Plains The bison, or buffalo, is an American conservation success story. In the 1800s, tens of millions roamed North America. Those numbers had plummeted to fewer than 1,100 animals when in the early 20th century, WCS sent Bronx Zoo-bred bison out west to re-establish the species in its native habitat. Together with Indigenous nations, we brought bison back from the edge of extinction. Today, WCS uses science-based solutions to conserve this species and supports Indigenous Peoples in maintaining viable populations so that bison can once again fulfill their essential ecological and cultural roles. In 2022, we sent six Bronx Zoo-born genetically pure bison to the Osage Nation's 17,400-hectare ranch in Oklahoma: to augment the genetics of the Osage's existing bison herd, and to help the tribe preserve their cultural heritage and the ecology of their ancestral lands. The return of bison to these lands benefits soil health, carbon storage, and the abundance and diversity of grassland plants, pollinators, amphibians, birds, and mammals, as well as revitalizing cultural and community well-being.""

<paragraph>: ""3 Excursion status means that the water quality has exceeded the permissible limits in either conductivity, chlorides and/or alkalinity which are parameters used to detect if injection fluid is leaving the wellfield. In the case of these five wells, the adjacent salt dome that has very high chlorides and conductivity has moved toward our monitor wells because of the constant bleed that is maintained. UEC is taking weekly samples, as opposed to the bimonthly requirement, but remediation is a challenge since this is not the injection fluid and the water cannot be pulled back. UEC will continue to monitor these wells twice a week and track the water quality. At the start of the new year, UEC will request the Texas Commission on Environmental Quality ('TCEQ') to reassess the status of the wells and if sampling can be returned to the normal schedule.""

This year, we had 59,881 metric tons of waste, of which 9,763 metric tons was hazardous and 50,118 metric tons was nonhazardous waste. Landfilled hazardous waste is disposed of through controlled confinement in a landfill that is lined, monitored, and in compliance with government regulations. We formed waste continuous improvement teams at each location, which completed waste stream analyses and developed waste reduction projects. 14 Hazardous waste disposal methods are confirmed by hazardous waste manifests. Non-hazardous waste disposal methods are confirmed based on vendor reports. Waste is reported based on shipment dates from our facilities. The other category includes waste disposed from cafeteria grease traps and using the U.S. EPA H141 code that is stored by the waste vendor and the disposal method is not provided to TPI.""

The provided paragraph does mention the company's efforts in reducing environmental impact, specifically through product packaging improvements. While it does not explicitly state a net-zero target or a detailed transition plan, the information about reducing waste and promoting recyclability and reuse can be considered part of a broader sustainability strategy that may contribute to a net-zero goal. The mention of collaborations with trade associations could also imply a broader industry engagement in sustainability efforts.

As part of this initiative, we relocated our global headquarters in fiscal 2020 from a 224,000 square foot campus in Braintree, Massachusetts to a 62,000 square foot LEED and ENERGY STAR certified office space in Boston, Massachusetts. We also took proactive measures during this program to rationalize our global real estate portfolio and consolidate certain locations outside of the U.S.""

In the present report, Geberit implements the current GRI Standards from 2021. The starting point is a  Materiality analysis that has been developed further over the years, which is based on the procedure described in the GRI Standards. An initial internal materiality analysis was thus developed in 2014 as part of workshops with individual members of the Group Executive Board and later approved by the Group Executive Board. The results were then reviewed and amended slightly by an external stakeholder panel. As part of the integration of the ceramics business, a comprehensive review was carried out in 2015. There were no major changes in the material topics. A further review and update of the material topics was carried out in 2018 as part of the switchover to the GRI Standards. In agreement with the Group Executive Board, the update of the materiality analysis in the reporting year focused on aligning it closely with the corporate strategy and sustainability strategy. The previously required listing of many individual GRI aspects was dispensed with. This resulted in fewer topics overall. The names of these topics are based on the corporate strategy and sustainability strategy, resulting in a consolidated name in some cases. The updated materiality analysis was reviewed and amended slightly by an external stakeholder panel in the reporting year. It became clear that a high degree of consensus existed between the internal standpoint of the company and the assessment of the stakeholder panel, see  Panel Statement. The finalised materiality analysis was checked and approved by the Group Executive Board and the Board of Directors.""

In addition to improving performance and delivering gross savings, these activities have allowed us to optimize our geographic footprint and modernize certain manufacturing operations in ways that have helped to meaningfully reduce our Scope 1 and 2 greenhouse gas ('GHG') emissions and total energy consumption. In fiscal 2018, we launched a strategic Complexity Reduction Initiative designed to improve operational performance and reduce costs. As part of this initiative, we relocated our global headquarters in fiscal 2020 from a 224,000 square foot campus in Braintree, Massachusetts to a 62,000 square foot LEED and ENERGY STAR certified office space in Boston, Massachusetts.

The Board focuses on the quality and scope of Haemonetics' risk management strategies and considers the most significant areas of risk inherent in the company's business strategies and operations as well as the steps that management is taking to mitigate those risks. Additionally, Board committees consider discrete categories of risk relating to their respective areas of responsibility. All committees report to the full Board as appropriate, including when a matter rises to the level of a material or enterprise-level risk. Senior management has overall responsibility for Haemonetics' risk management approach. This responsibility includes identifying, evaluating and addressing potential risks that may exist at the enterprise, strategic, financial, operational, compliance and reporting levels. Haemonetics' Global Internal Audit function, which reports regularly to the Audit Committee, serves as the primary monitoring and testing function for compliance with company-wide policies and procedures. We believe that the division of risk management responsibilities described above constitutes an effective program for addressing the risks inherent in the operation of our company and the achievement of our business objectives.""

Our Human Resources team reviews our compensation practices against the markets where we compete on a regular basis to ensure we are able to attract and retain top talent. COMPENSATION Haemonetics provides market-competitive base pay to compensate individuals for technical competencies required for their position and to help provide economic security. In addition to base salary, most of our employees have variable components to their compensation that are tied to achievement of corporate and individual performance goals, the fluctuations of our stock price, or a combination of both. We believe this approach fosters a pay-for-performance culture and, in the case of equity awards, helps to align the interests of employees and shareholders and promote a long-term shareholder perspective. Representatives of our Human Resources team conduct an annual risk assessment of Haemonetics' compensation programs and the findings are reviewed with the Compensation Committee. For fiscal 2022, the Compensation Committee agreed with management's conclusion that Haemonetics' compensation programs are designed with the appropriate balance of risk and reward in relation to Haemonetics' overall business strategy and do not create risk that is reasonably likely to have a material adverse effect on the company.""

<paragraph>: ""Suppliers are a critical part of the extended TPI team and work with us every day to meet and exceed the needs of our customers. We count on our suppliers to meet the same high standards for safety, quality, delivery, and cost that we place on ourselves. In addition to upholding TPI's expectations as communicated in our policies and procedures, we actively engage with our suppliers to develop a world-class sustainability program described below. TPI purchases materials, products, and services to support production across our global manufacturing facilities. The largest category within our global spend is direct raw materials. The primary raw materials are epoxy resins and adhesives, carbon reinforcements, advanced fiberglass fabrics, core materials (balsa wood and foam), coatings, lightning protection systems, and attachment hardware. Our raw material supply chain encompasses over 500 suppliers in more than 25 countries, with a spend of approximately 60% of our net sales including discontinued operations in 2022. We continue to expand our use of local and regional suppliers to ensure a continuous and uninterrupted supply of materials and reduce transportation distance and carbon emissions. During 2022, we audited more than 25 suppliers, approximately 60% of our annual supply spend, on a range of topics important to TPI such as EHS, quality, process control, ESG, and IDEA. We focus our auditing on new suppliers, suppliers that we have not audited in the last three years, or suppliers with operational changes.""
