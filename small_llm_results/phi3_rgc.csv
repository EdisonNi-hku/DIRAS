<question>: ""what are the social contributions or efforts mentioned?""
<paragraph>: ""It is a crescendo of attempts to bring the non-profit world closer to the profit world. Fashion experiments, studies products for disabled people, for example collections for wheelchair users. Others try to combine fragility and sustainability by creating a new strength. The for-profit world has realised that it is no longer enough to recover products, we must also recover people.From zero to half a thousand: what happens when solidarity becomes contagious? It was 2007 when six parents founded the association. Underlying this was the idea that everyone should do their share of the'investment'. Just as families had to put energy and passion into it, communities could engage in fundraising, while public bodies would play the role of facilitators. Businesses would eventually recognise the economic value of what we do. And so it went: in little more than ten years we have become a reference for 130 families, and then for another 200 who find answers for their children. Today we offer opportunities to work to more than 40 people with intellectual disabilities.""

Ensuring we implement strong risk assessment and due diligence processes is therefore critical.With greater visibility we have been able to improve the quality of our supplier data within this category, which in turn supported the more detailed modern slavery risk assessment that we undertook in the latter half of 2021. In the research conducted into the suppliers of our Accent owned brands, the majority of our suppliers in this category were rated inherently high for risks of modern slavery as their sourcing location was based on the country of manufacture, which for the suppliers of Accent owned brands is primarily in China.

But WCS also brings distinctive strengths to solving this crisis. Forests remain our greatest climate asset; globally, they remove a third of the CO$_{2}$ emitted each year from burning fossil fuels. And most of that removal is done by the kind of high-integrity forests and peatlands WCS field programs help protect.With our on-the-ground presence in more than 50 countries-including thousands of staff working closely with governments and communities-WCS can be a significant piece of the global climate solution. The key is to bring financial investment into conservation in a whole new way. Intact forests keep the planet as much as a degree cooler than it would be without their help.

It's clear that we are in no way separate from nature. Whether in the most remote regions or in the heart of a city, we are all linked to one another and to our animal relatives. We are mutually dependent. Africa's forest elephants, for instance, are like gardeners: they weed out smaller brush, which allows big trees to get bigger, locking away carbon. A single elephant contributes to many additional tons of CO$_{2}$ storage, helping regulate our climate. As an ecosystem ecologist, I think of species as parts of a larger system, and that's true of humans as well.""

The construction and real estate industries have a vital part to play in climate transition and are thereforedriving various initiatives to reduce carbon emissions in line with the Paris Agreement, particularly through the Road map for fossil free competitiveness that Peab has also signed onto. The construction and civil engineering industry, together with seven other trade organizations, work within the road map to achieve a climate neutral construction sector. This work comprises the entire value chain from planning and implementation to demolition and reuse.Creating sustainable cities includes energy efficient buildings and a construction process that uses material and processes in a climate-adapted manner.

<paragraph>: ""DAN: Climate change fundamentally threatens our core mission to save wildlife and wild places; we've all seen the harm done by worsening droughts and wildfires. But WCS also brings distinctive strengths to solving this crisis. Forests remain our greatest climate asset; globally, they remove a third of the CO$_{2}$ emitted each year from burning fossil fuels. And most of that removal is done by the kind of high-integrity forests and peatlands WCS field programs help protect.With our on-the-ground presence in more than 50 countries-including thousands of staff working closely with governments and communities-WCS can be a significant piece of the global climate solution. The key is to bring financial investment into conservation in a whole new way. Intact forests keep the planet as much as a degree cooler than it would be without their help. If we value that natural climate control-which is worth tens of trillions of dollars to the global economy-we can create sustainable protections for these vital ecosystems, the wildlife they shelter, and the climate itself.""

The goal in the future is to continue to reduce CO$_{2}$ intensity by an average of 5% per year.

The targeted reduction in emissions (Scopes 1 and 2) is equivalent to a contribution to a reduction path that limits CO$_{2}$ emissions to 'well below 2°C' above pre-industrial levels.A central element of the new CO$_{2}$ strategy is its integration in all relevant and existing business processes as well as the handling of CO$_{2}$ emissions as external costs by means of internal CO$_{2}$ pricing.""

<question>: ""Does the company have a clearly stated net-zero target and a transition plan how to reach it?""
<paragraph>: ""In the reporting year, the calculation of greenhouse gas emissions was updated with new basic data on the basis of the internationally recognised Ecoinvent database (version 3.8) and the IPCC (Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change) factors from 2013. Production-related process emissions are now also taken into consideration and, where possible, the effectively purchased local electricity mix (market-based) instead of the electricity mix of the respective country. Greenhouse gas emissions are calculated according to IPCC and are shown as a sum parameter (CO$_{2}$ equivalents or simply CO$_{2}$).Production emissions are recorded, calculated and analysed in detail as part of the corporate eco-balance. CO$_{2}$ emissions are particularly important to Geberit.  Other air emissions (NO$_{x}$, SO$_{2}$, hydrocarbons, etc.) are also recorded and calculated, but have a comparatively minor impact on the environment. The reduction of these emissions is directly related to the reduction targets of the CO$_{2}$ strategy.""

This is an initiative promoted by the Ministry of the Environment, Water and Ecological Transition, which seeks the active participation of industry to achieve the climate goals and objectives established in the first Nationally Determined Contribution of Ecuador to a carbon emissions reduction target of 22.5% by 2025 for the country.There are three stages to our strategy to reduce our carbon emissions:In the reporting period under review, SolGold has made significant strides to measure the necessary metrics to disclose our verified and validated emissions.SUSTAINABILITY REPORT CONTINUEDGreenhouse gas ('GHG ') emissionsSolGold has carried out the measurement of greenhouse gases ('GHG ') as detailed in the Carbon Reporting section of the Corporate Governance report. GHG emissions were measured from the operation of the Cascabel project and main exploration projects in Ecuador that can vary from year to year. There is a small margin of error in 2022 given the emissions produced from exploration activity in Sharug was not included.""

<paragraph>: ""As a community builder Peab has broad and diversified operations. We are active in four Nordic countries with an extensive geographic presence as well as customers in both the private and public sectors. Our four business areas Construction, Civil Engineering, Industry and Project Development are independent but ensure through collaboration that we utilize local resources as far as possible in the form of our own personnel and input goods. In other words, Peab's business comprises many different kinds of activities that come under the EU taxonomy. At the same time Peab's operations are characterized by further conditions that provide the framework for how our reporting according to the EU taxonomy should be understood. Our operations are primarily carried out as projects where every project is unique, which makes evaluating each project demanding. In our construction and civil engineering operations customers by and large formulate the specifications of the project. This reduces Peab's ability to influence the outcome, even if we work actively with holding dialogues with customers early on. In addition, lead times are long in the industry-from zoning to completed project-and therefore it takes years before new requirements are realized in operations and reporting.""

<paragraph>: ""The criteria for DNSH have been evaluated and Peab's ECO-products are considered to meet them.· Climate change adaptation: Considered met because we have performed climate risk and vulnerability analyses for all the manufacturing units of ECO-products and identified possible risk redu cing measures.· The sustainable use and protection of water and marine resources: Considered met because of compliance with valid laws since water activities and other situations that affect environment quality norms for water always require an Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) and taking relevant safeguards.· The transition to a circular economy: Considered met because Peab applies the industry's guidelines for waste management that steer towards sorting for possible material recycling. Peab also regularly evaluates the possibility of circular material flows concerning both input raw material for production and the recyclability of manufactured products. Examples of this are the binder Merit, based on slag which is a byproduct from the steel industry, our ECO-Ballast (ECO-Mineral aggregates) which is based on 100 percent reused raw material and is used in concrete and asphalt as well as reclaimed asphalt pavement as raw material in our paving production.

<question>: ""what the scope 3 says?""
<paragraph>: ""A wide range of measures for saving energy and increasing efficiency are planned at the plants. Accordingly, the area of ceramics, which accounts for around two-thirds of all Geberit's CO$_{2}$ emissions, has the largest structural savings potential. This includes a special focus on the reduction of scrap rates. The firing process and the use of the resulting waste heat will be further optimised. This can be used for other process steps, such as drying the cast plaster moulds or ceramic blanks. Furthermore, projects were launched to investigate the possibilities of switching to renewable energy sources-for example, ecologically produced hydrogen-in the long term as well as the systematic reuse of ceramic waste.Fuel consumption is determined primarily by the company's own and leased fleet of cars and delivery vans. Since early 2008, binding guidelines have also applied for the purchase of new vehicles. As of 2019, these guidelines were adjusted to take into account the new Worldwide Harmonised Light Vehicles Test Procedure (WLTP).""

The  Panel Statement confirms Geberit's perception-often expressed both internally and externally-that Geberit products are crucial for the added value of the company. Additionally, customers and other stakeholders are increasingly focusing on environmental and sustainability performance. The efficient handling of water remains one of the most important topics at Geberit. Saving water is directly linked to reducing energy consumption, which in turn indirectly reduces CO$_{2}$ emissions in the product use phase. The company has emphasised this link for years with reference to the  water footprint. Accordingly, Geberit's most significant contribution to climate change mitigation is then through water-saving solutions. An example of this is the new Acanto WC system solution with TurboFlush technology, which also features an extremely quiet flush and requires minimal cleaning.""

<paragraph>: ""In general, all of the topics included in the materiality analysis and the associated goals and measures are constantly promoted, see  Sustainability strategy. The  Panel Statement confirms Geberit's perception-often expressed both internally and externally-that Geberit products are crucial for the added value of the company. Additionally, customers and other stakeholders are increasingly focusing on environmental and sustainability performance. The efficient handling of water remains one of the most important topics at Geberit. Saving water is directly linked to reducing energy consumption, which in turn indirectly reduces CO$_{2}$ emissions in the product use phase. The company has emphasised this link for years with reference to the  water footprint. Accordingly, Geberit's most significant contribution to climate change mitigation is then through water-saving solutions. An example of this is the new Acanto WC system solution with TurboFlush technology, which also features an extremely quiet flush and requires minimal cleaning.""

This process included identifying each of our individual emissions sources and creating an inventory of these sources and their emissions released in the year. We also began implementing energy efficiency measures at our Wyoming operations, starting with transitioning the entire lighting system to LED.It is important to note that, like much of the uranium industry, we operated at a reduced pace to capture residual uranium only during the period the assessment was done. We expect our emissions to increase once we go into production; however, this assessment provides us a good baseline to begin to understand our emissions profile. From this baseline we will""

<paragraph>: ""DAN: Climate change fundamentally threatens our core mission to save wildlife and wild places; we've all seen the harm done by worsening droughts and wildfires. But WCS also brings distinctive strengths to solving this crisis. Forests remain our greatest climate asset; globally, they remove a third of the CO$_{2}$ emitted each year from burning fossil fuels. And most of that removal is done by the kind of high-integrity forests and peatlands WCS field programs help protect.With our on-the-ground presence in more than 50 countries-including thousands of staff working closely with governments and communities-WCS can be a significant piece of the global climate solution. The key is to bring financial investment into conservation in a whole new way. Intact forests keep the planet as much as a degree cooler than it would be without their help. If we value that natural climate control-which is worth tens of trillions of dollars to the global economy-we can create sustainable protections for these vital ecosystems, the wildlife they shelter, and the climate itself.""

I came to WCS because I think, right now, it's where I can have the greatest impact-building on the unrivaled work of our field conservation programs and connecting those assets to global policy and financesolutions. It's clear that we are in no way separate from nature. Whether in the most remote regions or in the heart of a city, we are all linked to one another and to our animal relatives. We are mutually dependent. Africa's forest elephants, for instance, are like gardeners: they weed out smaller brush, which allows big trees to get bigger, locking away carbon. A single elephant contributes to many additional tons of CO$_{2}$ storage, helping regulate our climate. As an ecosystem ecologist, I think of species as parts of a larger system, and that's true of humans as well.""

Cellulose fibres extracted from wood are also used in the fashion industry to create particularly versatile and popular fabrics.In the choice of cellulosic materials, which account for 4% of the total fibres used by OVS 6, we prefer those from forests managed according to the FSC (Forest Stewardship Council) or PEFC (Programme for the Endorsement of Forest Certification) standard and suppliers who adopt controlled processes such as Lenzing™, which guarantees both the origin of the raw material and reduced-impact production processes.""


The paragraph provided does not directly address the company's strategies for carbon credits or carbon removals, nor does it specify the types of verified carbon credits the company prefers or the quantity of these credits they have used. However, it does mention the use of cellulose fibers from forests managed according to certain standards, which could be part of a broader sustainability strategy that includes carbon management. The paragraph's focus on forest management and sustainable sourcing indirectly relates to carbon strategies, but it does not provide a comprehensive answer to the question.

[Guess]: No
[Confidence]: 0.7

The confidence level is set at 0.7 because while the paragraph does not directly answer the question, it does provide some context that could be related to the company's overall sustainability and carbon management practices. The mention of forest management and sustainable sourcing could be part of a broader carbon strategy, but without explicit information on biofuel usage, carbon credits, and carbon removals, the paragraph does not fully answer the question.<|end|>"

This is an initiative promoted by the Ministry of the Environment, Water and Ecological Transition, which seeks the active participation of industry to achieve the climate goals and objectives established in the first Nationally Determined Contribution of Ecuador to a carbon emissions reduction target of 22.5% by 2025 for the country.There are three stages to our strategy to reduce our carbon emissions:In the reporting period under review, SolGold has made significant strides to measure the necessary metrics to disclose our verified and validated emissions.SUSTAINABILITY REPORT CONTINUEDGreenhouse gas ('GHG ') emissionsSolGold has carried out the measurement of greenhouse gases ('GHG ') as detailed in the Carbon Reporting section of the Corporate Governance report. GHG emissions were measured from the operation of the Cascabel project and main exploration projects in Ecuador that can vary from year to year. There is a small margin of error in 2022 given the emissions produced from exploration activity in Sharug was not included.""

Returning instead to the subject of water, the company is also far ahead on the 'zero liquid discharge' theme: within a year, all water used in the production processes will be part of a closed cycle that allows it to be constantly reused, without the emission of waste water. What were the difficulties and challenges you had to overcome along the way? Paolo Lezza : All advanced technologies have a cost: the question is how to achieve the right efficiency to reduce it and remain competitive in the market. In this regard, the search for talent and human resources capable of handling these new technologies, which are also based on artificial intelligence, remains a key issue: in the case of the latest generation of machines, it is not so straightforward to find the right recipe, the appropriate mix of substances to be inserted or sprayed. Each process requires different skills: we, as OVS, are committed to supporting our supplier in these challenges, in order to achieve maximum efficiency for them and, consequently, also for us.""

To fulfil our commitment, we have thus increased the recycled portion on both cotton and polyester, as well as focused on specific materials from particularly emissionfriendly suppliers. In 2022, this was certainly more challenging, especially in light of the general and significant increase in raw material costs. In spite of this, we have chosen to go beyond these limits and take risks, e.g. by increasing sales prices, to ensure an increasingly sustainable product offering in line with our emission reduction targets.

<paragraph>: ""Accidents and days lost (GRI 403-9) The manufacture of sanitary products can generally be said to have a low level of risks at the workplace. Nevertheless, there are still some individual activities which entail an increased risk of accidents. Typical workplace risks are the lifting and carrying of heavy loads, working at heights and in noisy environments, as well as handling hot surfaces and hazardous substances. As part of the Geberit Safety System, the workplace risks are assessed systematically and appropriate measures implemented to protect the employees. Geberit is consistently pursuing the creation of safe and clean workstations at the production plants. This is carried out, for example, by optimising and modernising the systems and processes (e.g. an appliance for deburring sharp sheet edges when manufacturing installation modules), the replacement of hazardous substances (e.g. substitution of the pickling process in the manufacture of metal fittings) and the reduction of dust and noise emissions (e.g. by using more efficient extraction devices and filters in ceramic production). Workstations are also being further optimised from an ergonomic point of view through the increasing use of robots or lifting aids.""

TPI | 2022 ESG REPORT 17 Incident Management While we employ various preventative safety measures across our operations, we understand that accidents may happen and have processes in place to investigate and prevent future injuries. If an incident occurs, a root cause is identified, and corrective actions are implemented to address the hazard that led to the incident. All safety information is tracked and reviewed at each facility and with the leadership team. Incidents and corrective actions are then shared across facilities, along with significant good-catches, to ensure that best practices are implemented globally. A good-catch is the identification of a condition or behavior that has the potential to cause harm with timely intervention and corrective action before an incident occurs. In 2022, the number of good-catches submitted was more than 24,000.""

When it comes to biodiversity management, we are guided by local regulations, with a commitment to minimizing our disturbance of the local biodiversity. The ISR method we currently use results in significantly less land disturbance than underground or open pit mining. Therefore, our operational footprint in Texas and Wyoming is quite small compared to conventional mining. This is primarily due to the lack of tailings produced in the ISR process compared to conventional mining. Tailings facilities, which hold radioactive material, are often tens of acres in size and must be maintained indefinitely. ISR contains no tailings and, therefore, does not require this additional land. Further, none of our permitted sites are in or near areas that hold protected conservation status or endangered species habitat, according to U.S. federal guidelines.""

Our goal is to restore the orehosted groundwater back to pre-mining concentrations of metals, metalloids, cations and anions and total dissolved solids. To do this, we use reverse osmosis ('RO'), a water purification process that uses pressurized membranes to separate ions, unwanted molecules and larger particles from affected water.

<paragraph>: ""Reuse of products and packaging materials (GRI 301-3) Due to their long service life and the way in which they are installed, Geberit products can only be reused or recycled to a very limited extent. A targeted improvement in recyclability can be achieved by using recyclable thermoplastics instead of nonrecyclable duroplast plastics, as is the case with the manufacture of a WC seat and lid at the plant in Pfullendorf (DE). In the case of packaging materials, Geberit's goal-also as part of eco-design workshops-is to keep amounts as low as possible, to continuously increase the share of recycled material, and to simplify the recycling and return processes. Efforts to reduce packaging amounts are already starting to bear fruit. For example, certain packaging levels are being omitted, bags reduced in size or thinner foils used, while instructions are printed directly on the packaging rather than on paper, or replaced by a QR code. In addition, care is being taken to avoid the use of polystyrene (EPS) wherever possible and, where necessary, to replace it with recyclable cardboard. A good example here is the  redesign of the packaging for the sanitary flush unit. Proven standard packaging-introduced as part of an effort to reduce complexity-is now also being reviewed. Since 2021, WC lids are shipped in cardboard boxes that have been reduced in size as far as possible. These boxes are almost four times lighter than those used previously, cause 70% fewer CO$_{2}$ emissions and are both easier to use and cheaper to procure. The packaging of the MasterFix fittings was also revised in the reporting year. The annual material savings amount to 1.8 tonnes of cardboard and 58,000 m$^{2}$of plastic foil-an area equivalent to around eight football fields. This results in a saving of around 24 tonnes of CO$_{2}$ per year.""

On average, a single lithium battery consumes 1,700 fewer kWh/year than a traditional lead battery, which results in an average reduction of 600 kilograms (0.6 metric tons) of CO$_{2}$ e emissions per year per battery. The lithium forklift fleet in Italy currently has nearly 300 operational units and is expected to grow by 10% in 2023. Across Europe, lithium-battery-powered forklifts will also begin replacing traditionally battery-powered forklifts as they reach the end of their useful lives. In addition, some of these units will be able to be charged via solar panels installed at the sites.""

<paragraph>: ""Higher safety is another benefit of the collaboration between the Swedish Transport Administration and Peab. The project team works systematically to make the construction site safe and contributes to good safety culture. Theme days about safety where the contractor, customer and trade unions participate is an example of this. The team has also produced a work environment survey to find out what people at the site think about the work environment there. Information programs for skilled workers to raise safety awareness and experience exchanges to better employees' capability are two such activities. Internal investigations into serious accidents and incidents to prevent future accidents are of course also part of the systematic work on the work environment. The project has been awarded the Swedish Transport Administration's work environment award twice, which pays tribute to measures that promote collaboration and work on the work environment.""

<paragraph>: ""Rewilding Bison with Indigenous Partners From the Bronx Zoo to the Great Plains The bison, or buffalo, is an American conservation success story. In the 1800s, tens of millions roamed North America. Those numbers had plummeted to fewer than 1,100 animals when in the early 20th century, WCS sent Bronx Zoo-bred bison out west to re-establish the species in its native habitat. Together with Indigenous nations, we brought bison back from the edge of extinction. Today, WCS uses science-based solutions to conserve this species and supports Indigenous Peoples in maintaining viable populations so that bison can once again fulfill their essential ecological and cultural roles. In 2022, we sent six Bronx Zoo-born genetically pure bison to the Osage Nation's 17,400-hectare ranch in Oklahoma: to augment the genetics of the Osage's existing bison herd, and to help the tribe preserve their cultural heritage and the ecology of their ancestral lands. The return of bison to these lands benefits soil health, carbon storage, and the abundance and diversity of grassland plants, pollinators, amphibians, birds, and mammals, as well as revitalizing cultural and community well-being.""

Landfilled hazardous waste is disposed of through controlled confinement in a landfill that is lined, monitored, and in compliance with government regulations. We formed waste continuous improvement teams at each location, which completed waste stream analyses and developed waste reduction projects. 14 Hazardous waste disposal methods are confirmed by hazardous waste manifests. Non-hazardous waste disposal methods are confirmed based on vendor reports. Waste is reported based on shipment dates from our facilities. The other category includes waste disposed from cafeteria grease traps and using the U.S. EPA H141 code that is stored by the waste vendor and the disposal method is not provided to TPI.""

Social responsibility is realised among other things within the scope of diverse, local activities for inclusive jobs and global social projects relating to the core competencies of water and sanitary facilities. The UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) define concrete targets for 17 different themes, which the states are required to implement by 2030. Integration of the economy plays a pivotal role in implementing these targets and indicators. As a result, major opportunities with growth potential are also arising for companies geared towards sustainable products and services such as Geberit. In accordance with the assessment of the external stakeholder panel, Geberit sees its contribution above all in four UN Sustainable Development Goals. The contributions to goal number 6 'Ensure the availability and sustainable management of water and sanitation for all', number 8 'Promote sustainable economic growth, employment and decent work for all', number 9 'Build resilient infrastructure, promote sustainable industrialisation and foster innovation' and number 11 'Make cities safe, resilient and sustainable' are included in the  SDG Reporting. The major economic, environmental and social effects of Geberit's operations also lie in these four areas.""

<paragraph>: ""The solution GXO introduced new processes to help our customer meet its net-zero carbon target by 2035 through reusing, recycling or sending away products for energy recovery. One of GXO's innovative solutions was a method of washing produce trays that uses cold water instead of hot. A change in the cleaning chemical and washing equipment allowed us to maintain the same level of quality and hygiene, all with cold water. Outcomes By reducing energy that would have been used to heat the water, we were able to deliver financial and environmental savings to the customer. Since 2009, the customer has sent zero waste directly to a landfill. Each week, GXO handles an average of 5,375 metric tons of cardboard and 410 metric tons of plastic waste and washes 4.4 million trays. Twelve GXO sites operating 24/7/365 and employing a staff of 900 make 1.3 million equipment repairs and wash 260 million trays and more than 11 million flower buckets annually.""

<paragraph>: ""Our goal is to attract, develop and engage the best and brightest talent from all walks of life and backgrounds. To help us achieve our goal, we've developed a hiring strategy for building and sustaining a diverse, equitable and inclusive environment that includes internship programs, new hiring processes and strategic partnerships with historically Black colleges and universities (HBCUs) and Hispanic-serving institutions (HSIs). In 2021, we launched the STARs (Strengthening Talent for Accelerated Results) Program to ensure that recent college graduates have the support they need as their careers begin. STARs provides intensive in-person banking training followed by on-the-job, lineof-business-specific leadership skills training. STARs participants are a diverse group of college graduates recruited from university campuses, including HBCUs, throughout Texas and surrounding areas. In our inaugural year, we welcomed 58 young professionals into the program; in August 2022, we welcomed 60 more. Forty-four percent of the STARs Analysts hired were female and 25 percent were ethnically diverse.""

<paragraph>: ""Sustainability → Sustainability performance report → Reporting Practice Reporting Practice GRI 3-1 Process of determining material topics Since 2006, Geberit has been reporting in accordance with the guidelines of the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI). In the present report, Geberit implements the current GRI Standards from 2021. The starting point is a  Materiality analysis that has been developed further over the years, which is based on the procedure described in the GRI Standards. An initial internal materiality analysis was thus developed in 2014 as part of workshops with individual members of the Group Executive Board and later approved by the Group Executive Board. The results were then reviewed and amended slightly by an external stakeholder panel. As part of the integration of the ceramics business, a comprehensive review was carried out in 2015. There were no major changes in the material topics. A further review and update of the material topics was carried out in 2018 as part of the switchover to the GRI Standards. In agreement with the Group Executive Board, the update of the materiality analysis in the reporting year focused on aligning it closely with the corporate strategy and sustainability strategy. The previously required listing of many individual GRI aspects was dispensed with. This resulted in fewer topics overall. The names of these topics are based on the corporate strategy and sustainability strategy, resulting in a consolidated name in some cases. The updated materiality analysis was reviewed and amended slightly by an external stakeholder panel in the reporting year. It became clear that a high degree of consensus existed between the internal standpoint of the company and the assessment of the stakeholder panel, see  Panel Statement. The finalised materiality analysis was checked and approved by the Group Executive Board and the Board of Directors.""

<paragraph>: ""Across our operations, we strive to maintain the protection and positive out of box experience that appropriate packaging provides while reducing environmental impacts. This can be done through automated solutions to right-size packaging, such as our Small Order Automated Packing (SOAP) machine. Through the use of this technology, SOAP is able to process up to 700 packages per hour, leading to reductions in resource and energy use. HOME SOAP and similar technologies reduce the use of packing materials and reduce package sizing. This allows shipments to use less space on delivery trucks, leading to reduced road miles traveled. Packaging sized to fit can also reduce the likelihood of products becoming damaged during shipping and can require less plastic to fill empty spaces in cartons. In addition to reducing product packaging materials, we also reduce the materials required for shipment packaging.""

Our management team is responsible for managing risk on a day-to-day basis and for bringing to the Board's attention material risks facing the company. The Board focuses on the quality and scope of Haemonetics' risk management strategies and considers the most significant areas of risk inherent in the company's business strategies and operations as well as the steps that management is taking to mitigate those risks. Additionally, Board committees consider discrete categories of risk relating to their respective areas of responsibility. All committees report to the full Board as appropriate, including when a matter rises to the level of a material or enterprise-level risk. Senior management has overall responsibility for Haemonetics' risk management approach. This responsibility includes identifying, evaluating and addressing potential risks that may exist at the enterprise, strategic, financial, operational, compliance and reporting levels. Haemonetics' Global Internal Audit function, which reports regularly to the Audit Committee, serves as the primary monitoring and testing function for compliance with company-wide policies and procedures.

Our Human Resources team reviews our compensation practices against the markets where we compete on a regular basis to ensure we are able to attract and retain top talent. COMPENSATION Haemonetics provides market-competitive base pay to compensate individuals for technical competencies required for their position and to help provide economic security. In addition to base salary, most of our employees have variable components to their compensation that are tied to achievement of corporate and individual performance goals, the fluctuations of our stock price, or a combination of both. We believe this approach fosters a pay-for-performance culture and, in the case of equity awards, helps to align the interests of employees and shareholders and promote a long-term shareholder perspective.

TPI purchases materials, products, and services to support production across our global manufacturing facilities. The largest category within our global spend is direct raw materials. The primary raw materials are epoxy resins and adhesives, carbon reinforcements, advanced fiberglass fabrics, core materials (balsa wood and foam), coatings, lightning protection systems, and attachment hardware. Our raw material supply chain encompasses over 500 suppliers in more than 25 countries, with a spend of approximately 60% of our net sales including discontinued operations in 2022. We continue to expand our use of local and regional suppliers to ensure a continuous and uninterrupted supply of materials and reduce transportation distance and carbon emissions. During 2022, we audited more than 25 suppliers, approximately 60% of our annual supply spend, on a range of topics important to TPI such as EHS, quality, process control, ESG, and IDEA. We focus our auditing on new suppliers, suppliers that we have not audited in the last three years, or suppliers with operational changes.""

<paragraph>: ""The solution GXO introduced new processes to help our customer meet its net-zero carbon target by 2035 through reusing, recycling or sending away products for energy recovery. One of GXO's innovative solutions was a method of washing produce trays that uses cold water instead of hot. A change in the cleaning chemical and washing equipment allowed us to maintain the same level of quality and hygiene, all with cold water. Outcomes By reducing energy that would have been used to heat the water, we were able to deliver financial and environmental savings to the customer. Since 2009, the customer has sent zero waste directly to a landfill. Each week, GXO handles an average of 5,375 metric tons of cardboard and 410 metric tons of plastic waste and washes 4.4 million trays. Twelve GXO sites operating 24/7/365 and employing a staff of 900 make 1.3 million equipment repairs and wash 260 million trays and more than 11 million flower buckets annually.""
