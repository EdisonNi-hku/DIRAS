It outlines the governance structure for the company's strategy and sustainability efforts, including the roles of the Board of Directors and the Chief Executive Officer in operational management and implementation. However, it lacks details on financial projections, investment requirements for sustainability projects, risk assessments related to the sustainability transition, expected changes in market share or competitive advantage due to sustainability efforts, funding sources for the sustainability transition, or metrics used to track financial performance in relation to sustainability goals. Therefore, it does not directly answer the question regarding the inclusion of financial performance expectations in the transition plan.

It also mentions the review of strategies to mitigate, transfer, accept, or control risks, along with the assessment of potential impact and severity of each risk. However, it does not address the financial implications of the sustainability transition or provide information on how financial performance is expected to change over time given the strategy to achieve sustainability objectives and priorities.

[Reason]: The paragraph indicates that the company has a governance structure in place to oversee climate-related risks and opportunities, including the financial impact of these issues. It mentions the Board of Directors' role in deliberating, supervising, and monitoring strategies and action plans related to climate issues, with consideration of their financial implications. This suggests that the company's transition plan includes information on how it expects financial performance to change over time, given its strategy to achieve climate-related objectives and priorities. However, the paragraph does not provide detailed examples of financial projections, investment requirements, risk assessments, or specific metrics related to financial performance in the context of sustainability goals. It does, however, confirm the existence of a governance framework that would likely include such information, making it partially helpful in answering the question.

[Reason]: The paragraph provides information on how Toyota is considering different climate-related scenarios, including a 2°C or lower scenario, as part of its strategy for resilience in the face of climate change. It mentions the analysis of risk and opportunities based on these scenarios and the envisioning of future storylines for society. However, it does not explicitly mention financial performance projections or expectations related to the sustainability transition. The focus is more on strategic resilience and risk management rather than on financial implications of sustainability efforts. Therefore, while the paragraph indicates a strategic approach to sustainability that could indirectly impact financial performance, it does not directly answer the question regarding financial performance projections over time.

[Reason]: The paragraph provided focuses on environmental monitoring and compliance audits for specific projects within the company. It details the types of environmental monitoring carried out, the compliance with environmental audits, and the approval of the Advanced Exploration phase of the Cascabel Concession. However, it does not contain any information related to financial performance projections, investment requirements for sustainability projects, risk assessments related to the sustainability transition, expected changes in market share or competitive advantage due to sustainability efforts, details on funding sources for the sustainability transition, or metrics used to track financial performance in relation to sustainability goals. Therefore, it does not address the question regarding whether the transition plan includes information on how financial performance is expected to change over time given the strategy to achieve objectives and priorities outlined.

[Reason]: The paragraph provided focuses on the company's efforts in workplace safety, including hazard risk assessments, operational controls, employee safety ownership, incident investigation, and safety training. While these efforts are crucial for the well-being of employees, they do not directly address social contributions or efforts that benefit society beyond the workplace. The information given is more about internal safety and health measures rather than external social initiatives or community development projects that would contribute to the broader social good. Therefore, it does not provide the specific details on social contributions or efforts mentioned in the question.

It mentions the challenges of doing business while caring for children and the need for active participation from parents in projects that benefit families. However, it does not specifically mention any social contributions or efforts made by the company, such as community development projects, partnerships for social issues, employee well-being programs, or any other initiatives that directly contribute to society.

The for-profit world has realised that it is no longer enough to recover products, we must also recover people.From zero to half a thousand: what happens when solidarity becomes contagious? It was 2007 when six parents founded the association. Underlying this was the idea that everyone should do their share of the'investment'. Just as families had to put energy and passion into it, communities could engage in fundraising, while public bodies would play the role of facilitators. Businesses would eventually recognise the economic value of what we do. And so it went: in little more than ten years we have become a reference for 130 families, and then for another 200 who find answers for their children. Today we offer opportunities to work to more than 40 people with intellectual disabilities.""

[Reason]: The paragraph provides a general overview of the company's sustainability strategy and its alignment with the UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). It mentions the company's focus on sustainability and its impact on various stakeholders, including employees and society, in the areas of People, Planet, and Profit. However, it does not provide specific examples or details about social contributions or efforts, such as community development projects, partnerships with non-profit organizations, or initiatives aimed at promoting diversity and inclusion. The information is too general to answer the question directly, but it suggests that the company has a sustainability strategy that could include social contributions, making it somewhat relevant to the question.

For this reason, we have and will continue to focus here because we can have a greater impact.We are also especially committed to understanding the risks within this category as it constitutes a strategic priority for the business as we plan for continued growth. Ensuring we implement strong risk assessment and due diligence processes is therefore critical.With greater visibility we have been able to improve the quality of our supplier data within this category, which in turn supported the more detailed modern slavery risk assessment that we undertook in the latter half of 2021. In the research conducted into the suppliers of our Accent owned brands, the majority of our suppliers in this category were rated inherently high for risks of modern slavery as their sourcing location was based on the country of manufacture, which for the suppliers of Accent owned brands is primarily in China. This enabled a more tailored risk assessment and deeper analysis which we are using to target our direct supplier engagement.""

[Reason]: The paragraph provides information on how the organization, GXO, assesses climate-related risks through its Enterprise Risk Management (ERM) tool and its partnership with customers and site operations. It mentions the assessment of property risk annually to project and mitigate possible impacts due to climate change, including severe weather events. This directly addresses part of the question regarding the metrics used to assess climate-related risks. However, it does not explicitly mention metrics or indicators used for assessing opportunities related to climate change, nor does it detail how these metrics contribute to ensuring performance aligns with the organization's strategy and risk management process. Therefore, while the paragraph is helpful in showing that GXO has a structured approach to managing climate-related risks, it does not fully answer the question as it lacks details on metrics for opportunities and the alignment with strategy and risk management process.

[Reason]: The paragraph provides information about the organization's approach to managing and assessing climate-related risks and opportunities through the establishment of an ESG Working Group and engagement with ESG consulting firms. It mentions the collaboration with these groups to guide internal ESG and climate-risk initiatives, learn about industry best practices, and gauge emerging risks. Additionally, it highlights the participation of employees in climate-risk related seminars and conferences and the attainment of certifications like the International Association for Sustainable Economy (IASE) certification. However, the paragraph does not specify the exact metrics used by the organization to assess climate-related risks and opportunities, nor does it detail how these metrics contribute to ensuring performance aligns with strategy and risk management processes. Therefore, while the paragraph indicates an organizational structure and activities aimed at managing climate-related risks and opportunities, it lacks the specific metrics information required to fully answer the question.

[Reason]: The paragraph provides specific examples of metrics and actions taken by the organization to assess and manage climate-related risks and opportunities. It mentions the replacement of aging equipment with energy-efficient alternatives, installation of retrofit LED lighting, and the use of energy-efficient lighting and motion sensors. These actions directly relate to reducing energy consumption and greenhouse gas emissions, which are critical metrics for assessing climate-related risks and opportunities. Additionally, the paragraph discusses FNF's efforts in reducing Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions, which are important indicators of the organization's impact on the environment. However, the paragraph does not explicitly mention how these metrics help ensure performance aligns with the organization's strategy and risk management process. It implies a strategic alignment through the mention of environmental principles in their Environmental Policy Statement but lacks detailed explanations on how these metrics contribute to strategic goals and risk management practices.

<question>: ""What metrics does the organization use to assess climate-related risks and opportunities? How do these metrics help ensure that performance aligns with its strategy and risk management process?""
<paragraph>: ""DAN: Climate change fundamentally threatens our core mission to save wildlife and wild places; we've all seen the harm done by worsening droughts and wildfires. But WCS also brings distinctive strengths to solving this crisis. Forests remain our greatest climate asset; globally, they remove a third of the CO$_{2}$ emitted each year from burning fossil fuels. And most of that removal is done by the kind of high-integrity forests and peatlands WCS field programs help protect.With our on-the-ground presence in more than 50 countries-including thousands of staff working closely with governments and communities-WCS can be a significant piece of the global climate solution. The key is to bring financial investment into conservation in a whole new way. Intact forests keep the planet as much as a degree cooler than it would be without their help. If we value that natural climate control-which is worth tens of trillions of dollars to the global economy-we can create sustainable protections for these vital ecosystems, the wildlife they shelter, and the climate itself.""

<paragraph>: ""Q: How did you come to this work?DAN: I've focused on the intersection between forests and climate for more than 30 years, as a professor and then working in philanthropy. I came to WCS because I think, right now, it's where I can have the greatest impact-building on the unrivaled work of our field conservation programs and connecting those assets to global policy and financesolutions. It's clear that we are in no way separate from nature. Whether in the most remote regions or in the heart of a city, we are all linked to one another and to our animal relatives. We are mutually dependent. Africa's forest elephants, for instance, are like gardeners: they weed out smaller brush, which allows big trees to get bigger, locking away carbon. A single elephant contributes to many additional tons of CO$_{2}$ storage, helping regulate our climate. As an ecosystem ecologist, I think of species as parts of a larger system, and that's true of humans as well.""

[Reason]: The paragraph provides a general overview of Geberit's approach to risk monitoring and reporting, including the integration of climate change risks into their overall risk assessment. It mentions the company's compliance with the TCFD (Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures) and the delegation of authority on economic, environmental, and social matters, which suggests a structured approach to managing climate-related risks and opportunities. However, the paragraph does not offer specific details on the resilience of Geberit's strategy under different climate-related scenarios, including a 2°C target or lower scenario, nor does it provide detailed information on how the company plans to mitigate physical climate risks. It hints at a structured approach to risk management and governance that could indirectly contribute to resilience but lacks direct evidence or specific strategies related to climate resilience.

[Reason]: The paragraph provides information on Geberit's governance structure and its approach to sustainability, including climate-related risks and opportunities. It mentions the Board of Directors' direct responsibility for climate-related risks and opportunities and outlines specific sustainability strategy modules related to climate change mitigation, such as energy and CO$_{2}$ reduction, sustainable product development, and eco-design principles. However, it does not explicitly address the resilience of the organization's strategy under different climate-related scenarios, including a 2°C target or lower scenario, nor does it detail how the organization plans to manage and mitigate physical climate risks.

[Reason]: The paragraph provides information on the organization's commitment to environmental sustainability, including efforts to minimize environmental impacts, develop reduction strategies for energy consumption and waste, and integrate environmental considerations into business decisions. It specifically mentions the organization's goal to decarbonize its operations, aiming to reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions through the development of an emissions baseline and a decarbonization roadmap. This directly addresses parts of the question related to the organization's strategy under different climate-related scenarios, including a 2°C target or lower scenario, and its resilience to climate physical risks. However, the paragraph does not explicitly mention scenario planning exercises or risk assessments conducted to evaluate the impact of various climate-related scenarios on the organization's operations. It also lacks detailed information on the organization's operational and financial exposure to climate-related risks and opportunities under different global warming scenarios. Despite these limitations, the paragraph is still helpful in providing insight into the organization's strategic planning for climate resilience and its commitment to reducing GHG emissions.

[Reason]: The paragraph is helpful for answering the question because it outlines specific actions the organization is taking to address climate-related risks and opportunities. It mentions the development of a decarbonization roadmap for U.S. ISR projects, which directly relates to the organization's strategy under different climate-related scenarios, including a 2°C target or lower scenario. Additionally, the commitment to addressing the recommendations of the Task Force on Climate-Related Financial Disclosures (TCFD) indicates an effort to align strategic planning with international climate goals and to manage climate-related risks. The mention of conducting a climate-risk assessment and setting science-based targets also aligns with the question's interest in understanding how resilient the organization's strategy is when considering climate physical risks. However, the paragraph does not provide detailed information on the organization's operational and financial exposure to climate-related risks, nor does it offer specific examples of investments in climate resilience or scenario planning exercises. Despite these limitations, the paragraph does offer insight into the organization's strategic planning and risk management processes related to climate change, making it partially helpful in answering the question.

[Reason]: The paragraph provides information on the organization's risk management process, specifically mentioning the assessment of property risk annually to mitigate possible impacts due to climate change. This includes severe weather events like hurricanes, floods, and fires, which are increasing in frequency. This indicates that the organization is aware of and actively managing climate-related physical risks, such as extreme weather events. However, the paragraph does not explicitly mention a 2°C target or lower scenario, nor does it detail the organization's strategy under different climate-related scenarios beyond risk management for physical climate risks. Therefore, while the paragraph is helpful in showing the organization's resilience to some extent by managing physical climate risks, it does not fully answer the question regarding the organization's strategy under different climate-related scenarios, including a 2°C target or lower scenario.

[Reason]: The paragraph provides information on the organization's strategic planning related to climate change, specifically mentioning their goal of achieving carbon neutrality by 2040 and a more aggressive target for GXO U.K. to be net zero by 2045. This indicates that the organization is planning and setting targets to reduce its carbon emissions, which is relevant to understanding how resilient their strategy is when considering climate-related scenarios, including a 2°C target or lower scenario. However, the paragraph does not explicitly mention scenario planning exercises or risk assessments conducted to evaluate the impact of various climate-related scenarios on the organization's operations, supply chain, and market demand. It also lacks details on the organization's operational and financial exposure to climate-related risks and opportunities under different global warming scenarios, including a 2°C or lower scenario. Therefore, while the paragraph is somewhat helpful in showing the organization's commitment to reducing emissions and setting ambitious targets, it does not fully answer the question regarding the resilience of their strategy in the face of different climate-related scenarios and physical risks.

[Reason]: The paragraph provides information on the organization's environmental and social goals, including targets related to greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and carbon neutrality. It mentions the organization's commitment to ESG (Environmental, Social, and Governance) principles and outlines specific targets such as using LED lighting in 80% of global operations by 2025, diverting 80% of global landfill waste by 2025, and achieving 100% carbon neutrality by 2040. These targets align with the organization's strategy to mitigate climate change impacts and contribute to international climate goals, such as limiting global warming to 2°C above pre-industrial levels. However, the paragraph does not explicitly mention scenario planning exercises or risk assessments related to climate physical risks, nor does it detail the organization's resilience to different climate scenarios or how it plans to manage and mitigate physical climate risks.

[Reason]: The paragraph provides information on the organization's approach to assessing its compliance with the 'Do No Significant Harm' (DNSH) criteria, specifically in relation to climate change adaptation. It mentions the organization's analysis of vulnerability to chronic and acute physical climatic risks and the evaluation of adaptation solutions to reduce these risks. This directly addresses part of the question regarding the organization's strategy in considering climate physical risks. However, it does not explicitly mention a 2°C target or lower scenario, nor does it detail the organization's resilience to different climate-related scenarios beyond the DNSH criteria. Therefore, while the paragraph is helpful in showing the organization's efforts in assessing and adapting to climate physical risks, it does not fully answer the question regarding the resilience of the organization's strategy under different climate scenarios.

[Reason]: The paragraph provides information about the organization's governance structure for overseeing ESG (Environmental, Social, and Governance) risks, including climate risk. It mentions the establishment of the Sustainability Committee, its role in assisting the Board with oversight responsibilities related to sustainability, and its focus on climate risk among other areas. However, it does not detail specific processes, tools, or strategies used by the organization to identify and assess climate-related risks. The paragraph indicates a framework for oversight and governance but lacks specifics on climate risk assessment methods, tools, or procedures. Therefore, while it provides a general context for understanding how the organization approaches climate risk, it does not directly answer the question regarding specific processes used for identification and assessment.

[Reason]: The paragraph provides detailed information on the processes Toyota uses to identify and assess climate-related risks. It mentions the use of the TGRS (likely a risk assessment tool or framework) to extract vulnerabilities by region, function, and product, and assess them based on impact and vulnerability. It also outlines the roles of various committees, such as the Environmental Product Design Assessment Committee and Production Environment Committee, in identifying and assessing climate-related risks and opportunities. Furthermore, it describes the supervisory structure, including the involvement of Chief Officers and Company Presidents, in overseeing the implementation of countermeasures against climate-related risks. This directly addresses several aspects of the question, such as the use of climate risk assessment tools, engagement with committees for in-depth analyses, and procedures for regularly monitoring and updating the understanding of climate-related risks.

[Reason]: The paragraph provides information about the organization's Enterprise Risk Assessment (ERA) process, which includes the creation of a risk map based on severity and likelihood, setting targets to reduce risk, and reviewing progress by the Board semi-annually. It also mentions the implementation of an Integrated Management System (IMS) that includes quality, environmental, and occupational health and safety management. However, the paragraph does not specifically address climate-related risks or detail the processes used to identify and assess these risks. It focuses more on the general risk management framework and the integration of environmental management into the organization's overall management system. Therefore, while the paragraph indicates that the organization has a structured approach to risk management and environmental integration, it does not provide detailed information on the processes for identifying and assessing climate-related risks.

It's clear that we are in no way separate from nature. Whether in the most remote regions or in the heart of a city, we are all linked to one another and to our animal relatives. We are mutually dependent. Africa's forest elephants, for instance, are like gardeners: they weed out smaller brush, which allows big trees to get bigger, locking away carbon. A single elephant contributes to many additional tons of CO$_{2}$ storage, helping regulate our climate. As an ecosystem ecologist, I think of species as parts of a larger system, and that's true of humans as well.""

[Reason]: The paragraph provides information about the organization's governance structure and how it oversees ESG matters, including climate-related risks. It mentions the role of the Nominating and Governance Committee (NGC) in overseeing ESG, IDEA, and Board composition, indicating a formal process for managing ESG issues. Additionally, it discusses the development of ESG targets and their inclusion in executive compensation plans, which suggests a strategic approach to integrating ESG considerations into the organization's operations. However, the paragraph does not detail specific processes or tools used for identifying and assessing climate-related risks, such as climate risk assessment tools, engagement with external experts, or procedures for monitoring and updating climate risk assessments. Therefore, while the paragraph indicates a framework for managing ESG issues, it does not provide detailed information on the processes used to identify and assess climate-related risks.

[Reason]: The paragraph provided does not directly address the question regarding the processes the organization uses to identify and assess climate-related risks. Instead, it lists various sustainability accounting standards and indicators that the organization follows, including those related to energy management, greenhouse gas emissions, and workforce health and safety. While these standards and indicators are relevant to understanding the organization's sustainability practices, they do not specifically detail the methods, tools, or strategies employed for identifying and assessing climate-related risks. The paragraph mentions limited assurance engagement standards but does not provide information on climate risk assessment tools, engagement with external experts, procedures for monitoring climate risks, scenario analysis, integration into overall risk management, stakeholder engagement, or examples of responses to identified climate risks.

[Reason]: The paragraph provided does not directly address the question regarding the company's net-zero target and transition plan. Instead, it focuses on the Wildlife Conservation Society's (WCS) broader strategy to address biodiversity loss, climate change, and the pandemic, with a specific emphasis on protecting and rewilding species, reducing threats to wildlife, and promoting nature-positive solutions to the climate crisis. While these efforts are related to mitigating climate change and could indirectly contribute to a net-zero target, the paragraph does not explicitly mention a net-zero target or outline a detailed transition plan to achieve it by a specific date. Therefore, it does not provide the specific information required to answer the question about the company's net-zero target and transition plan.

<paragraph>: ""DAN: Climate change fundamentally threatens our core mission to save wildlife and wild places; we've all seen the harm done by worsening droughts and wildfires. But WCS also brings distinctive strengths to solving this crisis. Forests remain our greatest climate asset; globally, they remove a third of the CO$_{2}$ emitted each year from burning fossil fuels. And most of that removal is done by the kind of high-integrity forests and peatlands WCS field programs help protect.With our on-the-ground presence in more than 50 countries-including thousands of staff working closely with governments and communities-WCS can be a significant piece of the global climate solution. The key is to bring financial investment into conservation in a whole new way. Intact forests keep the planet as much as a degree cooler than it would be without their help. If we value that natural climate control-which is worth tens of trillions of dollars to the global economy-we can create sustainable protections for these vital ecosystems, the wildlife they shelter, and the climate itself.""

[Reason]: The paragraph provides information about the company's efforts in understanding and managing its greenhouse gas emissions, including the hiring of a third party to quantify emissions and the implementation of energy efficiency measures. However, it does not mention a clearly stated net-zero target or a detailed transition plan to achieve it. The paragraph focuses on the company's current efforts and baseline understanding of its emissions profile but lacks specific information on a net-zero target or a comprehensive strategy to reach it. Therefore, while the paragraph indicates an awareness and initial steps towards managing emissions, it does not directly answer the question regarding a net-zero target and transition plan.

[Reason]: The paragraph does not provide specific information about the company's net-zero target or a detailed transition plan to achieve it. It mentions the company's commitment to sustainability and outlines its efforts in conducting an ESG materiality assessment and implementing an ESG program. However, it lacks details on the company's specific goals for reducing greenhouse gas emissions to net-zero, the timeline for achieving this goal, or the strategies and actions it plans to take to reach this target. Therefore, while the paragraph indicates a general direction towards sustainability, it does not directly answer the question regarding a clearly stated net-zero target and a transition plan.

[Reason]: The paragraph provides information about the company's efforts to reduce its environmental impact, including a specific achievement in reducing Scope 1 and 2 greenhouse gas emissions by 19% compared to a baseline year. It also mentions plans to further reduce Scope 1 and 2 carbon emissions and assess Scope 3 emissions in the future. However, the paragraph does not explicitly mention a ""net-zero target"" or a detailed ""transition plan"" to achieve such a target. The information is more about the company's current and future actions towards reducing its carbon footprint without a clear commitment to reaching net-zero emissions by a specific date. Therefore, while the paragraph is helpful in showing the company's efforts towards reducing its environmental impact, it does not directly answer the question regarding a clearly stated net-zero target and a transition plan to reach it.

[Reason]: The paragraph provides a general overview of the company's commitment to sustainability and mentions the establishment of an ESG (Environmental, Social, and Governance) steering group to govern the sustainability agenda and align business strategies with ESG strategies. However, it does not specifically mention a net-zero target or a detailed transition plan to achieve it. The paragraph focuses more on the company's ethical and social responsibilities and its commitment to environmental initiatives without detailing a clear net-zero target or a roadmap to achieve it.

[Reason]: The paragraph provided does not offer specific information about the company's net-zero target or a detailed transition plan to achieve it. It mentions the company's commitment to sustainable business practices and outlines a general Sustainability Framework that includes environmental, social, and governance activities. However, it lacks details on specific goals, such as the year by which the company aims to achieve net-zero emissions, detailed strategies for reducing emissions, investments in renewable energy, or any other initiatives directly related to a net-zero transition plan.

However, it does not provide specific information about a clearly stated net-zero target or a detailed transition plan to achieve it. The mention of a new CO$_{2}$ strategy implies that there is a plan in place, but without details on the target year for net-zero emissions or specific strategies to achieve it, the paragraph does not fully answer the question.

<paragraph>: ""The Geberit Group stands for an ambitious and implementation-oriented approach in its activities. This also applies to the new CO$_{2}$ strategy developed in 2021 and implemented in the reporting year.. The goal in the future is to continue to reduce CO$_{2}$ intensity by an average of 5% per year. As such, Geberit is looking to achieve a long-term reduction in absolute CO$_{2}$ emissions from 183,886 tonnes in 2021 to 121,000 tonnes by 2035. In comparison with the reference year 2015, relative CO$_{2}$ emissions are to be reduced by 70% by 2030 and by 80% by 2035, while absolute CO$_{2}$ emissions are to fall by 47% and 50% by 2030 and 2035 respectively. The targeted reduction in emissions (Scopes 1 and 2) is equivalent to a contribution to a reduction path that limits CO$_{2}$ emissions to 'well below 2°C' above pre-industrial levels.A central element of the new CO$_{2}$ strategy is its integration in all relevant and existing business processes as well as the handling of CO$_{2}$ emissions as external costs by means of internal CO$_{2}$ pricing.""

[Reason]: The paragraph provides detailed information about the company's commitment to reducing CO$_{2}$ emissions, including specific targets for reduction in both absolute and relative terms, as well as a timeline for these reductions. It mentions a long-term reduction in absolute CO$_{2}$ emissions from 183,886 tonnes in 2021 to 121,000 tonnes by 2035, which directly addresses the question regarding the company's net-zero target. Additionally, the paragraph outlines the company's strategy to integrate CO$_{2}$ reduction into its business processes and handle CO$_{2}$ emissions as external costs through internal CO$_{2}$ pricing, which is part of the transition plan to reach the net-zero target. Therefore, the paragraph is helpful in answering the question as it confirms the company has a clearly stated net-zero target and outlines a transition plan to achieve it.

[Reason]: The paragraph provides information about the company's efforts in auditing and reporting its CO$_{2}$ emissions, including Scope 1, 2, and 3 emissions. It mentions the integration of annual CO$_{2}$ reduction targets into the Group's bonus system, which indicates a clear target for reducing emissions. However, it does not explicitly mention a net-zero target or a detailed transition plan to achieve it. The focus is more on the process of auditing and reporting emissions and the integration of reduction targets into the bonus system rather than outlining a comprehensive strategy to reach net-zero emissions. Therefore, while the paragraph shows an effort towards reducing emissions, it does not fully answer the question regarding a clearly stated net-zero target and a transition plan to reach it.

<paragraph>: ""In the reporting year, the calculation of greenhouse gas emissions was updated with new basic data on the basis of the internationally recognised Ecoinvent database (version 3.8) and the IPCC (Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change) factors from 2013. Production-related process emissions are now also taken into consideration and, where possible, the effectively purchased local electricity mix (market-based) instead of the electricity mix of the respective country. Greenhouse gas emissions are calculated according to IPCC and are shown as a sum parameter (CO$_{2}$ equivalents or simply CO$_{2}$).Production emissions are recorded, calculated and analysed in detail as part of the corporate eco-balance. CO$_{2}$ emissions are particularly important to Geberit.  Other air emissions (NO$_{x}$, SO$_{2}$, hydrocarbons, etc.) are also recorded and calculated, but have a comparatively minor impact on the environment.

[Reason]: The paragraph is helpful for answering the question because it provides specific information about the company's commitment to reducing greenhouse gas emissions by a certain percentage (46.2%) by a specific year (2030). This directly addresses the question regarding whether the company has a clearly stated net-zero target. Additionally, the mention of the Science Based Targets initiative (SBTi) indicates that the company's reduction targets are aligned with scientific parameters, which is relevant to understanding the company's transition plan. However, the paragraph does not provide detailed strategies or actions beyond the general mention of using sustainable materials and less impactful production processes. It also lacks information on investments in renewable energy, efforts to improve energy efficiency, initiatives to offset remaining emissions, policies for engaging suppliers, monitoring and reporting mechanisms, or collaborations with external organizations. Therefore, while the paragraph is useful in showing that the company has a net-zero target and is working towards it, it does not fully answer the question regarding the transition plan.

[Reason]: The paragraph provided does not offer specific information about the company's net-zero target or a transition plan to achieve it. It mentions the company's sustainability priorities, including climate impact and environmental work, but does not detail a clear net-zero target or outline specific strategies or actions to reach such a goal. The focus is more on the company's approach to sustainability and community engagement rather than on a specific net-zero transition plan. Therefore, it does not directly answer the question regarding the existence of a clearly stated net-zero target and a transition plan to reach it.

[Reason]: The paragraph provides information about SolGold's involvement in the Zero Carbon Ecuador Program, which indicates a commitment to reducing carbon emissions. It also mentions the company's efforts in measuring and disclosing its greenhouse gas emissions, which are crucial steps towards a net-zero target. However, the paragraph does not explicitly state a net-zero target for the company itself, nor does it outline a detailed transition plan with specific strategies or actions to achieve net-zero emissions. It focuses more on the company's participation in the program and its efforts in measuring emissions rather than detailing a roadmap to net-zero. Therefore, while the paragraph suggests a direction towards sustainability and emissions reduction, it does not fully answer the question regarding a clearly stated net-zero target and a transition plan to reach it.

[Reason]: The paragraph provided does not contain any information related to Scope 3 emissions or indirect emissions associated with the company's activities. Instead, it focuses on the Wildlife Conservation Society's (WCS) mission, conservation efforts, and the goal of protecting 30 percent of the planet by 2030. There is no mention of emissions from sources that the company does not own or control, such as transportation of raw materials, manufacturing by suppliers, employee business travel, waste disposal, or emissions from the use of sold products and services. Therefore, the paragraph does not address the question regarding what Scope 3 says about indirect emissions.

[Reason]: The paragraph provides a general overview of the company's efforts in reducing CO$_{2}$ emissions, mentioning the GHG Protocol and the inclusion of Scope 1, 2, and 3 emissions. However, it does not provide specific information about Scope 3 emissions, such as details on indirect emissions from activities like transportation of raw materials, manufacturing by suppliers, employee business travel, waste disposal, or emissions from the use of sold products and services. The mention of ""Tank to Wheel"" emissions and the distinction between CO$_{2}$ emissions during the production stage and during driving suggests a focus on direct emissions rather than indirect emissions associated with the company's activities. Therefore, while the paragraph indicates an awareness of the GHG Protocol and the inclusion of Scope 3 emissions, it does not offer detailed information on Scope 3 emissions themselves.

<paragraph>: ""As a community builder Peab has broad and diversified operations. We are active in four Nordic countries with an extensive geographic presence as well as customers in both the private and public sectors. Our four business areas Construction, Civil Engineering, Industry and Project Development are independent but ensure through collaboration that we utilize local resources as far as possible in the form of our own personnel and input goods. In other words, Peab's business comprises many different kinds of activities that come under the EU taxonomy. At the same time Peab's operations are characterized by further conditions that provide the framework for how our reporting according to the EU taxonomy should be understood. Our operations are primarily carried out as projects where every project is unique, which makes evaluating each project demanding. In our construction and civil engineering operations customers by and large formulate the specifications of the project. This reduces Peab's ability to influence the outcome, even if we work actively with holding dialogues with customers early on. In addition, lead times are long in the industry-from zoning to completed project-and therefore it takes years before new requirements are realized in operations and reporting.""

[Reason]: The paragraph provided does not directly address the question regarding Scope 3 emissions. It focuses on Peab's operations, including their geographic presence, business areas, and the challenges of reporting due to the uniqueness of each project and the influence of customers on project specifications. While it mentions the company's efforts to utilize local resources and collaborate across business areas, it does not specifically mention indirect emissions associated with their activities, such as those from transportation, manufacturing by suppliers, or waste disposal. Therefore, it does not provide information relevant to answering the question about what Scope 3 says.

<paragraph>: ""The criteria for DNSH have been evaluated and Peab's ECO-products are considered to meet them.· Climate change adaptation: Considered met because we have performed climate risk and vulnerability analyses for all the manufacturing units of ECO-products and identified possible risk redu cing measures.· The sustainable use and protection of water and marine resources: Considered met because of compliance with valid laws since water activities and other situations that affect environment quality norms for water always require an Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) and taking relevant safeguards.· The transition to a circular economy: Considered met because Peab applies the industry's guidelines for waste management that steer towards sorting for possible material recycling. Peab also regularly evaluates the possibility of circular material flows concerning both input raw material for production and the recyclability of manufactured products. Examples of this are the binder Merit, based on slag which is a byproduct from the steel industry, our ECO-Ballast (ECO-Mineral aggregates) which is based on 100 percent reused raw material and is used in concrete and asphalt as well as reclaimed asphalt pavement as raw material in our paving production.

[Reason]: The paragraph is helpful for answering the question because it directly mentions Scope 3 emissions, which are indirect emissions from the company's value chain upstream and downstream. It outlines the company's approach to measuring and managing these emissions, including engaging suppliers for data collection and developing a carbon reduction roadmap. This information is relevant to understanding what the company is doing in relation to Scope 3 emissions, which are critical for assessing the company's overall greenhouse gas emissions and its efforts to reduce them. Although the paragraph does not provide detailed data on Scope 3 emissions, it does offer insight into the company's strategies and actions related to these emissions, which is useful for answering the question about what Scope 3 says.

[Reason]: The paragraph is helpful for answering the question because it mentions the company's plans to expand its data collection process to include Scope 3 emissions in FY2023. This directly relates to the question about what Scope 3 says, as it indicates that the company is aware of and actively working on reporting indirect emissions associated with its activities, such as those from the production of purchased materials, transportation of purchased fuels, and use of sold products and services. Although the paragraph does not provide detailed information about Scope 3 emissions, the mention of future plans to include Scope 3 in their emissions reporting is relevant to the question.

[Reason]: The paragraph provided focuses on the company's efforts to understand and report its direct Scope 1 emissions and indirect Scope 2 emissions arising from energy use. It discusses the company's data collection processes, the sources of its Scope 1 emissions, and mentions a reduction in greenhouse gas emission intensity. However, it does not mention Scope 3 emissions, which are indirect emissions that occur in the company's value chain, such as emissions from the transportation of raw materials, manufacturing by suppliers, or emissions associated with employee business travel. Therefore, the paragraph does not address the question regarding what Scope 3 says, as it does not provide information on indirect emissions associated with the company's activities but not owned or controlled by the company.

This can be used for other process steps, such as drying the cast plaster moulds or ceramic blanks. Furthermore, projects were launched to investigate the possibilities of switching to renewable energy sources-for example, ecologically produced hydrogen-in the long term as well as the systematic reuse of ceramic waste.Fuel consumption is determined primarily by the company's own and leased fleet of cars and delivery vans.

[Reason]: The paragraph provided does not directly address the question regarding Scope 3 emissions. Instead, it focuses on the company's approach to managing physical and transitional risks and opportunities based on TCFD guidelines. It discusses the impact of climate change on the company's operations, such as increased energy demand due to rising temperatures and the potential for flooding at coastal production sites. However, it does not mention or provide information on indirect emissions associated with the company's activities, such as those from the transportation of raw materials, manufacturing by suppliers, or emissions from the use of sold products and services, which are the core of Scope 3 emissions.

<question>: ""what the scope 3 says?""
<paragraph>: ""Overall Scope 3 emissions were reduced by 6% compared to the previous year. OVS has defined Scope 3 emissionreduction targets on categories that are particularly relevant and where there is significant scope for action.As can be seen from the following table, thanks to an improved raw materials portfolio with a greater selection of low-impact materials and the reduction in the incidence of shipments by air, Scope 3 emissions decreased by 11% compared to 2019, substantially in line with the target of 12.6% defined by the objectives approved by SBTi. Considering the reduction per kg of product, the reduction is 12%.The significant reduction in transport emissions comes from the almost complete elimination of air transport. The slight upward shift from 2021 in emissions related to purchased Goods and Services should be read in light of the fact that in 2022, some purchases of finished goods were brought forward compared to the normal procurement curve typically adopted.""

[Reason]: The paragraph provides specific information about the company's efforts to reduce Scope 3 emissions, including details on the reduction in emissions due to changes in the raw materials portfolio and the elimination of air transport. It also mentions the slight increase in emissions related to purchased goods and services, which is relevant to understanding the company's Scope 3 emissions. This information directly addresses the question regarding what Scope 3 says, particularly in the context of the company's efforts to reduce these emissions. Therefore, the paragraph is helpful in answering the question because it offers insights into the company's Scope 3 emissions and its strategies for reducing these emissions.

[Reason]: The paragraph provides a general overview of Peab's approach to managing climate-related risks and opportunities, including the assessment of financial effects and resilience against these risks. It also mentions Peab's long-term environmental targets, including climate neutrality by 2045, and the use of measurements to monitor target achievement and climate impact. However, the paragraph does not provide specific information about the categories of Scope 3 emissions that Peab reports or the percentage of total emissions that these categories represent. It only mentions that Peab uses measurements including ""parts of Scope 3"" without detailing what these categories are or how significant they are in comparison to the company's total emissions. Therefore, while the paragraph indicates that Peab does track and report on Scope 3 emissions, it lacks the detailed information required to fully answer the question about the categories of Scope 3 emissions and their percentage of total emissions.

[Reason]: The paragraph provided focuses on the technical and environmental features of Geberit's urinal system and tap system, including their water and energy efficiency, electronic flush controls, and the development of a proprietary environmental and cost calculator. It discusses the company's efforts in sustainable building and economic operation through the use of autonomous energy sources and smartphone app control for energy management and water consumption. However, it does not mention any categories of Scope 3 emissions, nor does it provide information on the percentage of total emissions that are Scope 3 emissions. Therefore, the paragraph does not address the question regarding the categories of Scope 3 emissions and their percentage of total emissions for the reporting period.

[Reason]: The paragraph provides information on Geberit's strategies and initiatives aimed at reducing Scope 3 emissions, particularly through sustainable product design and supply chain management. It mentions efforts to reduce emissions by optimizing product use, material usage, and transportation routes, as well as the selection of low-carbon raw materials. However, it does not provide a breakdown of specific Scope 3 emission categories, such as emissions from purchased goods and services, business travel, or employee commuting, nor does it offer detailed figures on the percentage of total emissions that are Scope 3. Therefore, while the paragraph is relevant to understanding Geberit's approach to managing Scope 3 emissions, it does not directly answer the question regarding the categories of Scope 3 emissions reported and the percentage of total emissions that are Scope 3.

<paragraph>: ""In general, all of the topics included in the materiality analysis and the associated goals and measures are constantly promoted, see  Sustainability strategy. The  Panel Statement confirms Geberit's perception-often expressed both internally and externally-that Geberit products are crucial for the added value of the company. Additionally, customers and other stakeholders are increasingly focusing on environmental and sustainability performance. The efficient handling of water remains one of the most important topics at Geberit. Saving water is directly linked to reducing energy consumption, which in turn indirectly reduces CO$_{2}$ emissions in the product use phase. The company has emphasised this link for years with reference to the  water footprint. Accordingly, Geberit's most significant contribution to climate change mitigation is then through water-saving solutions. An example of this is the new Acanto WC system solution with TurboFlush technology, which also features an extremely quiet flush and requires minimal cleaning.""

[Reason]: The paragraph is helpful for answering the question because it provides specific information about the categories of Scope 3 emissions that the company, K&S, reports on. It mentions that they are collecting data relating to their Scope 3 emissions, specifically under the GHG Protocol categories 1 (purchased goods and services), 2 (capital goods), 4 (upstream transportation and distribution), and 6 (business travel). This directly addresses the first part of the question regarding the categories of Scope 3 emissions reported by the company. However, it does not provide information on the percentage of total emissions for the reporting period that are Scope 3, which is the second part of the question. Therefore, while the paragraph is useful in providing insight into the categories of Scope 3 emissions reported by the company, it does not fully answer the question as it lacks data on the significance of these emissions compared to the company's overall greenhouse gas emissions.

[Reason]: The paragraph provided does not offer specific information about the categories of Scope 3 emissions reported by the company or the percentage of total emissions that these categories represent. Instead, it focuses on the company's commitment to long-term sustainability objectives, its climate targets, and its efforts to reduce environmental impacts. While it mentions the company's engagement with the Science Based Targets initiative (SBTi), which implies a focus on emissions reductions, it does not detail Scope 3 emissions categories or percentages. Therefore, it does not directly answer the question regarding the categories of Scope 3 emissions and their percentage of total emissions for the reporting period.

[Reason]: The paragraph provides a breakdown of Scope 3 emissions categories reported by the company, including employee commuting, capital goods, downstream transportation and distribution, fuel-and-energy-related activities, upstream transportation and distribution, waste generated in operations, use of sold products, and end-of-life treatment of sold products. It also mentions the percentage of total emissions each category represents for the reporting period. However, it does not provide the total calculated Scope 3 emissions for the reporting period or the percentage this represents of the company's overall greenhouse gas emissions. Additionally, it discusses the company's initiatives to reduce Scope 3 emissions, such as sustainable packaging, but does not offer detailed information on the methodology used to calculate or estimate Scope 3 emissions in each reported category. Despite these limitations, the paragraph is still helpful because it addresses part of the question by listing the categories of Scope 3 emissions the company reports and provides some insight into the company's strategies to reduce these emissions.

While it mentions the company's efforts towards sustainability, it lacks detailed data on Scope 3 emissions, such as the sources of these emissions, the methodology used for calculation, or any significant changes in these emissions over time. Therefore, it does not directly answer the question regarding the categories of Scope 3 emissions and their percentage of total emissions for the reporting period.

[Reason]: The paragraph is helpful for answering the question because it specifically mentions the company's efforts in identifying and reporting Scope 3 emissions, particularly in the category of Business Travel figures for 2022. This directly addresses the first part of the question regarding the categories of Scope 3 emissions the company reports. However, it does not provide detailed information on the total Scope 3 emissions for the reporting period or the percentage of total emissions that Scope 3 represents. Therefore, while the paragraph is useful in indicating that the company is tracking and reporting some categories of Scope 3 emissions, it does not fully answer the question regarding the significance of these emissions compared to the company's total greenhouse gas emissions.

[Reason]: The paragraph provides a general overview of the organization's sustainability efforts, including initiatives related to health and safety, diversity and inclusion, community partnerships, and environmental sustainability. However, it does not specify any targets related to understanding, quantifying, or benchmarking climate-related risks and opportunities. The mention of a ""Carbon Emissions Project"" suggests that the organization is actively working on climate-related issues, but without detailed information on specific targets or progress towards these targets, it does not directly answer the question. Therefore, while the paragraph indicates an interest in sustainability and possibly climate-related issues, it lacks the detailed information required to fully answer the question about the organization's targets and performance against these targets.

<paragraph>: ""TPI | 2022 ESG REPORT 34In a continuation of our program, in 2022, we achieved our waste rate reduction goal (5% reduction during the year) by focusing our projects on optimizing direct material usage.This year, we had 59,881 metric tons of waste, of which 9,763 metric tons was hazardous and 50,118 metric tons was nonhazardous waste. Landfilled hazardous waste is disposed of through controlled confinement in a landfill that is lined, monitored, and in compliance with government regulations.We formed waste continuous improvement teams at each location, which completed waste stream analyses and developed waste reduction projects.14 Hazardous waste disposal methods are confirmed by hazardous waste manifests. Non-hazardous waste disposal methods are confirmed based on vendor reports. Waste is reported based on shipment dates from our facilities. The other category includes waste disposed from cafeteria grease traps and using the U.S. EPA H141 code that is stored by the waste vendor and the disposal method is not provided to TPI.""

[Reason]: The paragraph provided does not offer detailed information on the various carbon strategies such as biofuel, carbon credits, or carbon removals. It mentions the company's efforts in assessing near-term emissions reduction goals and identifying emissions hot spots in their supply chain through a scope 3 screening exercise. However, it does not specify any investment in biofuel technology, mention the use of carbon credits, or detail any carbon removal projects. Therefore, it does not directly answer the question regarding the company's carbon strategies, the types of verified carbon credits they prefer, or the quantity of these credits used.

[Reason]: The paragraph provided focuses on the environmental compliance audit and the lack of environmental non-compliance incidents during the reporting period. It mentions the process of approval for environmental audits and the company's commitment to reporting on incidents classified as medium and high risk. However, it does not mention any specific tools, instruments, or strategies used to manage climate risks. The information is more about compliance and reporting rather than proactive measures to mitigate climate risks. Therefore, it does not directly answer the question regarding the tools or instruments used to manage climate risks.

[Reason]: The paragraph provided does not specifically mention tools or instruments used to manage climate risks. Instead, it outlines the objectives and general processes of the company's risk management system, focusing on risk prevention, strategic planning, risk identification, assessment, prioritization, and response implementation. While risk management is a critical component of managing climate risks, the paragraph does not detail any climate-specific tools, technologies, strategies, or frameworks that the company employs to identify, assess, and mitigate climate change risks. Therefore, it does not directly answer the question regarding the use of tools or instruments to manage climate risks.

<question>: ""what tools or instrument are beeing used to manage climate risks?""
<paragraph>: ""It is well known that we need to drastically reduce our dependence on fossil fuels in order to achieve the goal of limiting global warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius. But there is less awareness that we have natural solutions to the climate crisis available right now. For example, the earth's forests sponge up 30 percent of the carbon dioxide we release into the atmosphere each year-and they will keep doing this work for us if we make sure they are not cut down.In this section, you can read about how WCS is leading global efforts to advance nature-positive solutions to the climate crisis-from protecting the forests of the Congo Basin, the largest tropical net carbon sink on Earth, to conserving the peatlands of boreal Canada, which store even more carbon than intact forests. And since some of the effects of climate change are unavoidable, WCS is also working to help wildlife, ecosystems, and communities adapt to changing conditions.""

[Reason]: The paragraph provided does not offer specific information on how the company expects its financial performance to change over time, given its strategy to achieve sustainability objectives and priorities. It focuses on the outcomes of the GXO program, such as enhanced supply chain speed and accuracy, reduced emissions, and the reuse of returned products. While these outcomes indicate a shift towards sustainability, the paragraph does not include financial projections, analysis of investment requirements, risk assessments related to the sustainability transition, expected changes in market share or competitive advantage due to sustainability efforts, details on funding sources for the sustainability transition, or metrics used to track financial performance in relation to sustainability goals. Therefore, it does not directly answer the question regarding the financial implications of the sustainability transition.

In spite of this, we have chosen to go beyond these limits and take risks, e.g. by increasing sales prices, to ensure an increasingly sustainable product offering in line with our emission reduction targets.

[Reason]: The paragraph provided focuses on the company's partnership and commitment to working with minority depository institutions (MDIs), including details about a specific deposit relationship with OneUnited Bank. It discusses the company's efforts in community development and corporate responsibility, particularly in terms of financial inclusion and support for minority-owned businesses.

There is no mention of forecasted financial statements, investment requirements for sustainability projects, risk assessments related to the sustainability transition, expected changes in market share or competitive advantage due to sustainability efforts, details on funding sources for the sustainability transition, or metrics used to track financial performance in relation to sustainability goals. Therefore, the paragraph does not provide useful information for answering the question about the financial implications of the company's sustainability transition plan.

The information is more focused on the current financial situation and recent sustainability initiatives rather than projections or expectations about future financial implications of these initiatives. Therefore, while the paragraph hints at sustainability efforts and a stable profit in 2022, it lacks detailed information on financial projections or expectations related to sustainability goals.

<paragraph>: ""Accidents and days lost (GRI 403-9) The manufacture of sanitary products can generally be said to have a low level of risks at the workplace. Nevertheless, there are still some individual activities which entail an increased risk of accidents. Typical workplace risks are the lifting and carrying of heavy loads, working at heights and in noisy environments, as well as handling hot surfaces and hazardous substances. As part of the Geberit Safety System, the workplace risks are assessed systematically and appropriate measures implemented to protect the employees. Geberit is consistently pursuing the creation of safe and clean workstations at the production plants. This is carried out, for example, by optimising and modernising the systems and processes (e.g. an appliance for deburring sharp sheet edges when manufacturing installation modules), the replacement of hazardous substances (e.g. substitution of the pickling process in the manufacture of metal fittings) and the reduction of dust and noise emissions (e.g. by using more efficient extraction devices and filters in ceramic production). Workstations are also being further optimised from an ergonomic point of view through the increasing use of robots or lifting aids.""

[Reason]: The paragraph primarily discusses the company's environmental sustainability efforts, focusing on reducing waste and promoting a circular economy. While it mentions the alignment with United Nations Sustainable Development Goals and the impact on carbon footprints, it does not explicitly mention social contributions or efforts. The information is more centered on environmental sustainability rather than social initiatives or programs that directly benefit society. Therefore, it does not directly answer the question regarding social contributions or efforts mentioned.

[Reason]: The paragraph provides detailed information about a specific initiative undertaken by GXO Logistics to reduce polyethylene waste for a premier fashion brand. This initiative involves the introduction of a recycling process for polyethylene waste, which is transformed into reusable resources and eventually recycled back into new polyethylene-based products. This effort directly contributes to environmental conservation and indirectly to social contributions by addressing the issue of waste management and pollution, which can have negative impacts on communities and ecosystems. Although the paragraph does not explicitly mention social contributions or efforts in the context of social responsibilities, the environmental conservation initiative has a social component by improving the community's health and well-being through reduced pollution and waste management. Therefore, the paragraph is helpful in answering the question to some extent, as it provides information about an environmental conservation effort that has a social component.

When it comes to biodiversity management, we are guided by local regulations, with a commitment to minimizing our disturbance of the local biodiversity. The ISR method we currently use results in significantly less land disturbance than underground or open pit mining. Therefore, our operational footprint in Texas and Wyoming is quite small compared to conventional mining. This is primarily due to the lack of tailings produced in the ISR process compared to conventional mining. Tailings facilities, which hold radioactive material, are often tens of acres in size and must be maintained indefinitely.

[Reason]: The paragraph provided does not directly address the question regarding the specific metrics used by the organization to assess climate-related risks and opportunities, nor how these metrics contribute to aligning performance with strategy and risk management. Instead, it focuses on the process of conducting materiality assessments, including the involvement of employees and external stakeholders, and the update of a customer survey to gather sustainability-related feedback. While these processes are related to understanding and managing sustainability issues, they do not offer specific metrics or indicators related to climate change, such as carbon footprint measurement, water usage efficiency, or financial performance metrics linked to sustainability. Therefore, the paragraph does not provide the necessary information to answer the question about climate-related risk and opportunity assessment metrics.

<question>: ""What metrics does the organization use to assess climate-related risks and opportunities? How do these metrics help ensure that performance aligns with its strategy and risk management process?""
<paragraph>: ""In fiscal 2020, we began an Operational Excellence Program under the leadership of our Executive Vice President, Global Manufacturing and Supply Chain. This program was designed to, among other things, improve product and service quality, reduce cost principally in our manufacturing and supply chain operations and ensure sustainability. Our Operational Excellence Program has helped contribute to overall reductions in our GHG emissions and energy by further rightsizing our geographic footprint, focusing manufacturing operations in locations with more energy-efficient power grids and upgrading our global facilities. For example, in fiscal 2022 we began the relocation of our Leetsdale, Pennsylvania manufacturing operations to a new Center of Excellence in Clinton, Pennsylvania. The Clinton facility incorporates several environmentally-focused features, including smart controls on the HVAC systems and a recycled compressor heat system for more efficient temperature control. During fiscal 2022, we also integrated Cardiva's Guaymas, Mexico plant into our manufacturing portfolio, which in 2019 received the Shingo Bronze Medallion for operational excellence.""

[Reason]: The paragraph provides information on the organizational structure and responsibilities for implementing sustainability measures, including the roles of individual business units, Sustainability and Process Management, and a network of EHS managers. It mentions the involvement of production plants, Group logistics, and Group purchasing in specific sustainability modules, such as green production, green logistics, and sustainable supply chains. However, it does not specify any metrics or indicators used to assess climate-related risks and opportunities. The focus is on the implementation and coordination of sustainability measures rather than on the metrics themselves or how they contribute to aligning performance with strategy and risk management. Therefore, while the paragraph indicates an organizational framework for sustainability efforts, it does not directly answer the question regarding specific metrics used for climate risk and opportunity assessment.

Our goal is to restore the orehosted groundwater back to pre-mining concentrations of metals, metalloids, cations and anions and total dissolved solids. To do this, we use reverse osmosis ('RO'), a water purification process that uses pressurized membranes to separate ions, unwanted molecules and larger particles from affected water.

[Reason]: The paragraph provides specific information about the organization's efforts to reduce energy usage and emissions at its facilities, including details on energy reduction projects, total energy usage, and emissions figures. It also mentions the impact of stopping production at certain facilities and switching to grid electricity at another facility as contributing factors to a decrease in emissions. However, the paragraph does not explicitly address the organization's strategy in the context of different climate-related scenarios, including a 2°C target or lower scenario, nor does it discuss climate physical risks directly. While the actions described are part of a broader strategy to mitigate climate change impacts, the paragraph lacks explicit scenario planning or risk assessment details that would directly answer the question about the resilience of the organization's strategy under different climate scenarios.

[Reason]: The paragraph provides specific information about the organization's efforts to reduce energy consumption and greenhouse gas emissions at one of its facilities, the Suzhou plant. It mentions the installation of solar panels and the implementation of an Intelligent Energy Management System to monitor and manage energy use. These initiatives align with the organization's strategy to reduce its operational exposure to climate-related risks and opportunities under different global warming scenarios, including a 2°C or lower scenario. However, the paragraph does not explicitly mention scenario planning exercises or risk assessments conducted to evaluate the impact of various climate-related scenarios on the organization's operations, supply chain, and market demand. It also lacks details on the organization's long-term strategies to align with international climate goals or agreements, investment in climate resilience beyond the Suzhou plant, or engagement with stakeholders on climate resilience and sustainability issues.

<paragraph>: ""Reuse of products and packaging materials (GRI 301-3) Due to their long service life and the way in which they are installed, Geberit products can only be reused or recycled to a very limited extent. A targeted improvement in recyclability can be achieved by using recyclable thermoplastics instead of nonrecyclable duroplast plastics, as is the case with the manufacture of a WC seat and lid at the plant in Pfullendorf (DE). In the case of packaging materials, Geberit's goal-also as part of eco-design workshops-is to keep amounts as low as possible, to continuously increase the share of recycled material, and to simplify the recycling and return processes. Efforts to reduce packaging amounts are already starting to bear fruit. For example, certain packaging levels are being omitted, bags reduced in size or thinner foils used, while instructions are printed directly on the packaging rather than on paper, or replaced by a QR code. In addition, care is being taken to avoid the use of polystyrene (EPS) wherever possible and, where necessary, to replace it with recyclable cardboard. A good example here is the  redesign of the packaging for the sanitary flush unit. Proven standard packaging-introduced as part of an effort to reduce complexity-is now also being reviewed. Since 2021, WC lids are shipped in cardboard boxes that have been reduced in size as far as possible. These boxes are almost four times lighter than those used previously, cause 70% fewer CO$_{2}$ emissions and are both easier to use and cheaper to procure. The packaging of the MasterFix fittings was also revised in the reporting year. The annual material savings amount to 1.8 tonnes of cardboard and 58,000 m$^{2}$of plastic foil-an area equivalent to around eight football fields. This results in a saving of around 24 tonnes of CO$_{2}$ per year.""

[Reason]: The paragraph provides information about the organization's efforts in quantifying its greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and implementing energy efficiency measures, which are steps towards reducing its operational exposure to climate-related risks. However, it does not explicitly mention the organization's strategy in relation to different climate-related scenarios, including a 2°C target or lower scenario, nor does it detail how the organization plans to manage and mitigate climate physical risks. The paragraph focuses on the initial stages of the organization's decarbonization journey, including the assessment of emissions and the implementation of energy efficiency measures, but lacks broader strategic planning or scenario analysis related to climate resilience.

<paragraph>: ""Conflict Minerals 3TG: Tantalum, Tin, Tungsten and Gold Hazardous Substances RoHS, REACH, TSCA To manage our commitment to provide conflict-free products, a cross-functional global Conflict Mineral Committee was established in FY2013 to oversee our due diligence journey guided by our CM policy. K&S files an annual CM report with the SEC 7 declaring our due diligence progress with our extensive supply chain on the mine source tracing and the mitigation actions in the event that a conflicted source is found. We require our tier-1 suppliers to provide full disclosure of the origin of 3TG minerals used in their products, including their sub-tier suppliers down to the smelter sources. We also conduct yearly audits on selected 'high risk' suppliers to verify that their CM processes and disclosures are in conformance. K&S takes any violation of our conflict minerals policy seriously, taking action to the extent of disengaging suppliers who do not comply.""

[Reason]: The paragraph provided focuses on the organization's processes for managing conflict minerals, specifically the establishment of a Conflict Mineral Committee, annual reporting to the SEC, and auditing of suppliers to ensure compliance with conflict minerals policies. It does not mention any processes related to identifying and assessing climate-related risks. The information given is about managing ethical sourcing and compliance with regulations related to conflict minerals, rather than addressing climate change risks.

On average, a single lithium battery consumes 1,700 fewer kWh/year than a traditional lead battery, which results in an average reduction of 600 kilograms (0.6 metric tons) of CO$_{2}$ e emissions per year per battery. The lithium forklift fleet in Italy currently has nearly 300 operational units and is expected to grow by 10% in 2023. Across Europe, lithium-battery-powered forklifts will also begin replacing traditionally battery-powered forklifts as they reach the end of their useful lives. In addition, some of these units will be able to be charged via solar panels installed at the sites.""

[Reason]: The paragraph provided focuses on specific operational changes and technological upgrades within the organization, such as the integration of lithium batteries in forklifts to reduce electricity needs and CO$_{2}$ emissions. While these initiatives demonstrate the organization's efforts towards sustainability and reducing its carbon footprint, they do not directly address the processes used to identify and assess climate-related risks. The paragraph does not mention any specific methods, tools, or strategies employed for climate risk assessment, such as climate risk assessment software, engagement with external experts, or procedures for monitoring and updating climate risk understanding. Therefore, it does not provide information relevant to the question about identifying and assessing climate-related risks.

[Reason]: The paragraph provided does not offer any specific information about the processes Geberit uses to identify and assess climate-related risks. Instead, it focuses on the company's commitment to water conservation and its efforts in establishing the Unified Water Label Association. While these initiatives suggest a general interest in sustainability and resource efficiency, they do not directly address the question regarding climate risk assessment processes. The paragraph lacks details on climate risk assessment tools, engagement with external experts, monitoring procedures, scenario analysis, integration into overall risk management, stakeholder engagement, previous responses to climate risks, or policies for assessing new projects for climate-related risks.

<paragraph>: ""Rewilding Bison with Indigenous Partners From the Bronx Zoo to the Great Plains The bison, or buffalo, is an American conservation success story. In the 1800s, tens of millions roamed North America. Those numbers had plummeted to fewer than 1,100 animals when in the early 20th century, WCS sent Bronx Zoo-bred bison out west to re-establish the species in its native habitat. Together with Indigenous nations, we brought bison back from the edge of extinction. Today, WCS uses science-based solutions to conserve this species and supports Indigenous Peoples in maintaining viable populations so that bison can once again fulfill their essential ecological and cultural roles. In 2022, we sent six Bronx Zoo-born genetically pure bison to the Osage Nation's 17,400-hectare ranch in Oklahoma: to augment the genetics of the Osage's existing bison herd, and to help the tribe preserve their cultural heritage and the ecology of their ancestral lands. The return of bison to these lands benefits soil health, carbon storage, and the abundance and diversity of grassland plants, pollinators, amphibians, birds, and mammals, as well as revitalizing cultural and community well-being.""

[Reason]: The paragraph provides a list of standards and indicators related to sustainability, including energy management, direct and indirect greenhouse gas emissions, and diversity of governance bodies. However, it does not explicitly mention a net-zero target or a transition plan to achieve it. The information is more about the company's sustainability practices and reporting mechanisms rather than a specific commitment to net-zero emissions and a detailed strategy to get there. Therefore, while the paragraph indicates an awareness and reporting on sustainability issues, it does not directly answer the question regarding a clearly stated net-zero target and a transition plan.

[Reason]: The paragraph provides information about Haemonetics' efforts to reduce its greenhouse gas emissions and energy consumption through restructuring activities, relocation of its global headquarters to a more energy-efficient space, and rationalization of its global real estate portfolio. However, it does not mention a specific net-zero target or a detailed transition plan to achieve such a goal. The information is more about the company's current actions and improvements rather than a long-term commitment to net-zero emissions or a strategic plan to get there. Therefore, while the paragraph shows the company's engagement in reducing its environmental impact, it does not directly answer the question regarding a clearly stated net-zero target and a transition plan to reach it.

<paragraph>: ""The solution GXO introduced new processes to help our customer meet its net-zero carbon target by 2035 through reusing, recycling or sending away products for energy recovery. One of GXO's innovative solutions was a method of washing produce trays that uses cold water instead of hot. A change in the cleaning chemical and washing equipment allowed us to maintain the same level of quality and hygiene, all with cold water. Outcomes By reducing energy that would have been used to heat the water, we were able to deliver financial and environmental savings to the customer. Since 2009, the customer has sent zero waste directly to a landfill. Each week, GXO handles an average of 5,375 metric tons of cardboard and 410 metric tons of plastic waste and washes 4.4 million trays. Twelve GXO sites operating 24/7/365 and employing a staff of 900 make 1.3 million equipment repairs and wash 260 million trays and more than 11 million flower buckets annually.""

To help us achieve our goal, we've developed a hiring strategy for building and sustaining a diverse, equitable and inclusive environment that includes internship programs, new hiring processes and strategic partnerships with historically Black colleges and universities (HBCUs) and Hispanic-serving institutions (HSIs). In 2021, we launched the STARs (Strengthening Talent for Accelerated Results) Program to ensure that recent college graduates have the support they need as their careers begin. STARs provides intensive in-person banking training followed by on-the-job, lineof-business-specific leadership skills training. STARs participants are a diverse group of college graduates recruited from university campuses, including HBCUs, throughout Texas and surrounding areas. In our inaugural year, we welcomed 58 young professionals into the program; in August 2022, we welcomed 60 more. Forty-four percent of the STARs Analysts hired were female and 25 percent were ethnically diverse.""

[Reason]: The paragraph provided does not offer specific information about the categories of Scope 3 emissions reported by the company or the percentage of total emissions that these categories represent. Instead, it focuses on the company's management standards, compliance policies, and the reporting criteria used for the Selected Information, including references to the World Business Council for Sustainable Development (WBCSD) / World Resources institute (WRI) Greenhouse Gas Protocol and the Sustainability Accounting Standards Board. While these references suggest a framework for reporting greenhouse gas emissions, they do not detail the Scope 3 emission categories or their significance in comparison to the company's total emissions. Therefore, the paragraph does not directly answer the question regarding Scope 3 emissions categories and their percentage of total emissions.

[Reason]: The paragraph provided does not offer specific information about the categories of Scope 3 emissions reported by the company, nor does it provide a percentage of total emissions for the reporting period that are attributed to Scope 3. Instead, it focuses on the company's achievements in safety, diversity, equity, and inclusion, as well as its production of wind blades and the resulting CO$_{2}$ e reduction. While the mention of CO$_{2}$ e reduction indirectly relates to Scope 3 emissions (as it is a category of indirect emissions), the paragraph does not break down these emissions into specific categories or provide a detailed analysis of Scope 3 emissions in comparison to the company's total emissions.

[Reason]: The paragraph provided focuses on the company's direct emissions (Scope 1 and Scope 2) and mentions the total energy consumption of the OVS Group, including the proportion of renewable energy sources. However, it does not mention or report on Scope 3 emissions, which are indirect emissions that occur in the company's value chain. Therefore, the paragraph does not offer information on the categories of Scope 3 emissions the company reports or the percentage of total emissions that are Scope 3 for the reporting period.

<paragraph>: ""Sustainability → Sustainability performance report → Reporting Practice Reporting Practice GRI 3-1 Process of determining material topics Since 2006, Geberit has been reporting in accordance with the guidelines of the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI). In the present report, Geberit implements the current GRI Standards from 2021. The starting point is a  Materiality analysis that has been developed further over the years, which is based on the procedure described in the GRI Standards. An initial internal materiality analysis was thus developed in 2014 as part of workshops with individual members of the Group Executive Board and later approved by the Group Executive Board. The results were then reviewed and amended slightly by an external stakeholder panel. As part of the integration of the ceramics business, a comprehensive review was carried out in 2015. There were no major changes in the material topics. A further review and update of the material topics was carried out in 2018 as part of the switchover to the GRI Standards. In agreement with the Group Executive Board, the update of the materiality analysis in the reporting year focused on aligning it closely with the corporate strategy and sustainability strategy. The previously required listing of many individual GRI aspects was dispensed with. This resulted in fewer topics overall. The names of these topics are based on the corporate strategy and sustainability strategy, resulting in a consolidated name in some cases. The updated materiality analysis was reviewed and amended slightly by an external stakeholder panel in the reporting year. It became clear that a high degree of consensus existed between the internal standpoint of the company and the assessment of the stakeholder panel, see  Panel Statement. The finalised materiality analysis was checked and approved by the Group Executive Board and the Board of Directors.""

<paragraph>: ""Among our latest innovations that benefit the environment is the development of a fluxless Thermo-Compression Bonding (TCB) process that eliminates contamination concerns while ensuring interconnect integrity. Fluxless bonding is environmentally friendly in the following ways: · Reduced water and energy consumption as no flux cleaning is required · Waste reduction as no flux is manufactured or disposed There is no large infrastructure change involved with fluxless bonding, since it is an extension of standard semiconductor assembly practices. To achieve our goal of reducing the environmental footprint of our products, we collaborate with our customers to understand changing needs and requirements and build efficiency considerations into the design phase of our product development process. We adopt a Knowledge Driven Product Development (KDPD) framework comprising four stages from initial conception and market research through to product commercialization.""

That number reached 93.4% in the U.K. and Europe. As a result of our work on this front, we remain on track to exceed our 2025 target of 80% landfill diversion globally. To keep moving in the right direction, we are instituting composting initiatives, developing durable pallets from recycled plastics, and hosting friendly cross-site competitions to incentivize waste diversion. We have numerous zero-waste sites across our operations, including one in Spain that has recently gone through Green Business Certification Inc.'s TRUE Zero Waste rating process.

In addition to improving performance and delivering gross savings, these activities have allowed us to optimize our geographic footprint and modernize certain manufacturing operations in ways that have helped to meaningfully reduce our Scope 1 and 2 greenhouse gas ('GHG') emissions and total energy consumption. In fiscal 2018, we launched a strategic Complexity Reduction Initiative designed to improve operational performance and reduce costs. As part of this initiative, we relocated our global headquarters in fiscal 2020 from a 224,000 square foot campus in Braintree, Massachusetts to a 62,000 square foot LEED and ENERGY STAR certified office space in Boston, Massachusetts. We also took proactive measures during this program to rationalize our global real estate portfolio and consolidate certain locations outside of the U.S.""

Our management team is responsible for managing risk on a day-to-day basis and for bringing to the Board's attention material risks facing the company. The Board focuses on the quality and scope of Haemonetics' risk management strategies and considers the most significant areas of risk inherent in the company's business strategies and operations as well as the steps that management is taking to mitigate those risks. Additionally, Board committees consider discrete categories of risk relating to their respective areas of responsibility. All committees report to the full Board as appropriate, including when a matter rises to the level of a material or enterprise-level risk. Senior management has overall responsibility for Haemonetics' risk management approach. This responsibility includes identifying, evaluating and addressing potential risks that may exist at the enterprise, strategic, financial, operational, compliance and reporting levels. Haemonetics' Global Internal Audit function, which reports regularly to the Audit Committee, serves as the primary monitoring and testing function for compliance with company-wide policies and procedures.

Representatives of our Human Resources team conduct an annual risk assessment of Haemonetics' compensation programs and the findings are reviewed with the Compensation Committee. For fiscal 2022, the Compensation Committee agreed with management's conclusion that Haemonetics' compensation programs are designed with the appropriate balance of risk and reward in relation to Haemonetics' overall business strategy and do not create risk that is reasonably likely to have a material adverse effect on the company.""

One of GXO's innovative solutions was a method of washing produce trays that uses cold water instead of hot. A change in the cleaning chemical and washing equipment allowed us to maintain the same level of quality and hygiene, all with cold water. Outcomes By reducing energy that would have been used to heat the water, we were able to deliver financial and environmental savings to the customer. Since 2009, the customer has sent zero waste directly to a landfill. Each week, GXO handles an average of 5,375 metric tons of cardboard and 410 metric tons of plastic waste and washes 4.4 million trays.

<question>: ""what tools or instrument are beeing used to manage climate risks?""
<paragraph>: ""Fidelity National Financial 2 Preserving the Environment : FNF works to integrate environmental management practices into our operations and facilities. We recognize our duty to protect the environment and acknowledge that environmental changes could pose risk to our business. In 2021, we undertook our inaugural Climate Risk Assessment to identify climate-related risks that may impact our operations and manage them effectively through our enterprise risk management program. We implemented measures to reduce our environmental footprint across our various locations. These initiatives encompass monitoring and mitigating our carbon footprint, eliminating the use of plastic water bottles, and participating in recycling programs. By digitizing an industry traditionally reliant on paper, we successfully introduced customer-centric technology that significantly reduces paper consumption in real estate transactions. We are committed to driving the title insurance industry toward a more sustainable direction.""
